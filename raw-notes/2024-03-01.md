# Dev Notes Week of March 01

### Wednesday: API Documenation Read through
- [x] Read through [API Documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/using-the-rest-api)
- Utilizing the API is important because it provides a structured way to access content within your WordPress site
- [AJAX Documentation](https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/javascript/ajax/)
  - All WordPress AJAX requests must be sent to wp-admin/admin-ajax.php
  - For a page from the public area, you will need to establish the correct URL yourself and pass it to jQuery using `wp_localize_script()`
    - The URL that will work for both the front and back end is available as a property of a global object that you will define in the PHP segment. In jQuery it is referenced like so: `my_ajax_obj.ajax_url`
  - All data is sent in an array - For requests that could result in a change to the database you need to send a nonce so the server knows the request came from a legitimate source
  - variable scope in closures only extends one level - this is why in the examples they do `var $this2 = this;`
  - The $ inside the function refers to the jQuery library
  - To see all jQuery methods, in the console you can run `console.log(jQuery());`

### Thursday
- SuppSupp helped with a couple technical (customization) tickets [1](https://lw.slack.com/archives/C01T0TSD4SC/p1708752168619759) & [2](https://lw.slack.com/archives/C01SBD5T03V/p1709143942670699)
  - First one helped me learn about API a bit more and second one might be a bug
- [X] Create a flowchart to help standardize and guide support when asking questions

### Friday
- [ ] Look at PR notes from G
- [ ] Adjust code - instead of buttons have a form that accepts parameters
  - i.e. posts per page
