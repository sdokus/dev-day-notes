# GOAL: Get Dev Site Working Again

### Background :
I was trying to test something for a support ticket and when I tried to test purchasing a ticket, there was a super buggy behavior where the attendees were never added to the Attendee List, but I could see the WooCommerce order. I tried testing on sandbox and it was not reproducible. 

In response to this I tried deleting and then re-downloading (via Github and the CLI) Event Tickets

Now I'm getting errors about a fatal happening when trying to activate ET and I think it's because the common.json file is not being pulled from github for whatever reason. 

## Notes:
- How to install a plugin via CLI and Github:
  - Go to GitHub and find the repo of the plugin you want to install 
  - Copy SSH 
  - In the terminal, navigate to the `/plugin` directory 
  - `git clone —recursive [SSH]`
  - `cd` to that plugin's directory
  - `composer install && nvm use && npm install && npm run build`
  - If there’s a `/common` directory in the plugin, `cd` into that directory and then `composer install && nvm use && npm install && npm run build` again

  - My problem seems to be that in my older instructions I was doing `slic use` and then `slic composer install` and this was not adding the correct folders to the `vendor` directory
  - It won't show in these notes, but that took me a couple of hours to get to the bottom of... I figured out what the problem was (required folders missing) by reading the fatal error message, but it took me a lot of researching around to find the solution for how to avoid that issue

- HOWEVER, the main issue where the Attendees are not showing is still happening :( 
  - Trying to delete and then re-install WC
  - Trying to delete and then re-clone ETP 
  - Adjusted setting in Tickets > Settings > Integrations to generate attendee records as soon as order is placed, and that seemed to do the trick - still kinda confused but glad it's sorted out
