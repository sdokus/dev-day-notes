# GOAL: Tribe__Context - increase understanding and start documentation

## APPROACH:
- Use ChatGPT to create a plugin that can be executed in different places (aka a shortcode)
- Test what happens to Tribe__Context while moving the shortcode around
- Investigate ‘ContextTest.php’ and ‘locations.php’

## NOTES:
- add_shortcode() is a function built-in to WordPress core: documentation
- The parameters are string $tag, callable $callback
- $tag is the string to be used in the placeholder brackets to identify which shortcode is being used
- $callback is the function that will be executed when the tag is triggered
- Every shortcode callback is passed three parameters by default, including an array of attributes ($atts), the shortcode content or null if not set ($content), and finally the shortcode tag itself ($shortcode_tag), in that order.

### Create a plugin to render shortcode:

- Singleton Design Pattern:
    - The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance. It is often used when you need to ensure that a class has a single, shared instance throughout the application.
Documentation

- Setting up the shortcode to display Tribe__Context information
  - Using ContextTest.php to understand better how to access the variables in Tribe__Context
  - The general structure of the test seems to be that a new instance of Tribe__Context is needed for each test (usually held in $sut, I wonder why it’s called that)
  - Eventually figured out that using tribe_context() is a factory method for creating a new instance of Tribe__Context
  - Quick side note - the :: and -> operators are used to access different types of properties and methods based on their visibility (public, private, etc) and whether they are associated with the class itself or its instances (objects).
    - Static = `::` (Scope Resolution Operator)
    - Non-static `=` -> (Object Operator)


- I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to pull the locations array into the shortcode and then iterate over a nested array, BUT turns out there are muuuuch simpler ways to achieve this with built-in methods:
```php
$context = tribe_context();
// Get all the location keys and their associated values
$locations = $context->to_array();
```
- And then this array can be imploded to output everything as a string
- The implode() function in PHP works as the join() function in JS

- Here is the endpoint for the shortcode, which seems to be working as expected:
```php
<?php
/**
* Plugin Name: Context Checker
* Plugin URI: https://www.yourwebsite.com
* Description: This is a simple plugin that creates a shortcode using singleton pattern.

*/


use function PHPSTORM_META\type;


if ( ! defined( 'ABSPATH' ) ) {
exit; // Exit if accessed directly.
}


// Check that a singleton pattern is being used
if ( ! class_exists( 'Tribe_Context_Dev' ) ) {


// Since there are no other instances, create the class here
class Tribe_Context_Dev {


// Holds the single instance of the class when it is instantiated. Can only be accessed within this class
private static $instance = null;


// Allows the single instance to be retrieved only once, even if the plugin files are loaded multiple times(e.g. on different pages)
public static function get_instance() {
if ( self::$instance == null ) {
self::$instance = new Tribe_Context_Dev();
}
return self::$instance;
}
private function __construct() {
add_shortcode( 'location_info', array( $this, 'render_shortcode' ) );
}


public function render_shortcode( $atts ) {
// Get the context instance
$context = tribe_context();


// Get all the location keys and their associated values
$locations = $context->to_array();


// Prepare the output HTML
$output = '<ul>';
foreach ( $locations as $key => $values ) {
if ( empty( $values ) ) {
$values = 'No value';
} elseif ( is_array( $values ) ) {
$values = implode( ', ', $values );
}


$output .= '<li><strong>' . esc_html( $key ) . ':</strong> ' . esc_html( $values ) . '</li>';
}
$output .= '</ul>';


// Return the location information
return $output;
}
}


// Initializes the Singleton Pattern
Tribe_Context_Dev::get_instance();
}
```
