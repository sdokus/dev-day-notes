# JustJavascript Notes

## Main concepts
- Primitive values are immutable  
- Non-primitive values (objects) are mutable
  - AKA they can be created (but not destroyed... instead the "garbage" gets cleared eventually but we don't have control over when)

## Equality of Values
I knew about strict equals (`===`) and loose equals (`==`) but I hadn't heard of Same Value Equality (`Object.is(a, b)`) before. The latter returns a boolean if two given values are the same value or not.

`===` and `Object.is(a, b)` are virtually the same _except_ with `NaN` and `-0`

## Properties
Properties _belong_ to a particular object. Properties don't _contain_ values, the _point_ to them!

When the property is assigned matters; AKA the order of execution matters.

Properties can be infinitely pointing back to the same object, but that must be assigned outside the object declaration. 
  > Assignment happens in three steps: (1) find the wire on the left, (2) find the value on the right, (3) point the wire to that value.

## Mutation
This is where the mapping and wires get important to visualize. 

Mutation `===` Change

This is where `let` vs `const` comes in!
