### Lando/Docker Troubleshooting
- Problems:
  - Stable-dev was working for ~10 minutes but then only returning 404s
  - Seeing an error message that `database` is failing its healthcheck
  - Tried updating Lando to version 3.20.6 since it said that there was a fix related to nginx upstream
  - Also seeing an error `[ECONNREFUSED] CONNECT ECONNREFUSED 127 0 0 1 443`:
    - tried running `curl -v http://127.0.0.1:443` which confirmed that the connection is being refused
    - Faintly remember a similar issue with port conflicts
    - But checking port 443 is doesn't look like there's anything on it `sudo lsof -i :443 | grep LISTEN`
  - Also seeing `ERROR ==> unknown shorthand flag: 'T' in -T` for why the healthcheck is failing
    - I think this is indicating an incompatibility in versions (maybe since I updated Lando?)
- Just going to create a new site so I can move on - NEVERMIND getting the same errors, I think it's a port conflict
- Issue seems to have been that I had Docker and OrbStack running at the same time
  - Updated and then killed everything in Docker and closed the app
  - Destroyed and started stable-dev app again and this time it worked! 
  - However it seems like it's running in Docker (extremely slow) and NOT in OrbStack at all 
  - Needed to go to OrbStack and re-migrate Docker Data
  - Stopped and restarted Lando - back to timeout errors (probably because Docker and OrbStack are running again?)
  - Tried deleting containers in Docker, quitting Docker completely and starting lando again - got an error that Docker needs to be running for lando to work (makes sense, I was thinking OrbStack worked without Docker, but maybe it doesn't)
  - OrbStack had an update available so I tried that - restarted computer and lando started all over again 
  - Back to getting the database failure error - containers seem to only be running in Docker (not OrbStack)
  - Re-migrated data to OrbStack, now getting 404 errors 
  - `lando destroy` `lando start` --> now the app connects again and seems to be fine... I'm guessing it will 404 out again though
  - It's only 404ing on the front end - also just noticed that instead of `stable.dev.lndo.site` it's `stable-dev.lando.site:4433`
    - Also noticed that the slug was generating differently and sure enough permalinks were set to plain - changed to postname and now the frontend is loading! 
    - This is from [proxy things](https://docs.lando.dev/core/v3/proxy.html) - I think there were some wires getting crossed with Docker and OrbStack competing for ports, completely trashing and quitting Docker Desktop and then destroying and starting lando again resolved all the weirdness

### WP CLI for fresh site:
```CLI
lando wp theme activate twentytwentyone 
lando wp plugin activate the-events-calendar events-pro event-tickets event-tickets-plus woocommerce query-monitor
lando wp option update timezone_string 'America/Denver'
```
