# GOAL: Keep exploring slic tests 

## Approach: 
- [X] Update `build` script to include `rm -rf composer.lock` in TEC directory and `--no-dev` in common
- [X] Update plugins on dev site
- [X] Practice getting slic up and running again 
- [ ] Rewrite test for testing how setting affects TEC

## Additional Dev Day To Do:
- [ ] Submit KB request for Kandence snippet
- [ ] Convert ticket flowchart to Mermaid.js file? 
- [ ] ORM documentation? 
- [ ] Tribe_Context documentation? 
- [ ] Start prepping for dev rant?

## Notes
- Another review of slic workflow: `slic up` --> `slic run ...`
  - Had to [ask for help again in #tec-dev](https://lw.slack.com/archives/G01H7Q57P1C/p1697217592123029) - this time for the error `Error: No such network: slic249_slic
    Error: No such network: slic249_default`
  - If you have previously set slic up in a project you do not have to run anything more than the commands above (except maybe slic use to point it to a different plugin)

#### Re-writing the test for changing settings to change date format instead of multiDay:
- Use WP CLI to check the setting options for TEC
  - Seems like PHPStorm might need some extra configuration to be able to run `lando wp`
