# When Updating Plugins

`composer install --no-dev && nvm use && npm ci && npm run build`


From Stephen: 
```
cd the-events-calendar (or event-tickets)
git checkout master && git pull && git supdate (or whatever your alias is)
cd common
git checkout master && git pull && git supdate
cd ../
git status - if this isn't clean, master is out of sync
```

# Troubleshooting the Template File Path Issues

## Starting with [ETP-888](https://stellarwp.atlassian.net/browse/ETP-888)
- Confirmed where the file affects the frontend and updated the steps to recreate in the ticket
- Tried investigating up the code stack - My understanding is that the template is registered through `tribe_tickets_get_template_part()`
  - It also looks like there's an element of calling the `tribe` container with the slug of the template 
- Did debugging in this file `wp-content/plugins/event-tickets/src/template-tags/tickets.php` 
  - `tribe_tickets_get_template_part()` function, specifically at line 731 was coming up in the stack trace
  - It says the `$slug` and the `$template` are both `tickets-plus/attendee-list-checkbox-rsvp.php`
  - It seems like that is where the template is being applied, but I can't see anything specific about when this does or doesn't work
- Tried finding where template overrides _are_ working - files in the `v2` and `tickets-wallet-plus` directories could successfully be overidden, but it looked like it was also being put in a `tickets-plus` directory right after `tribe`
  - That made me think that maybe instead of `[your-theme]/tribe/tickets-plus/attendee-list-checkbox-rsvp.php` it should be `[your-theme]/tribe/tickets-plus/tickets-plus/tattendee-list-checkbox-rsvp.php`, but that didn't work
  - Also tested a file at the base of the `tickets-plus` directory (`attendees-list.php`) and the file path was also not working (`[your-theme]/tribe/tickets-plus/attendees-list.php`)
    - I'm wondering if wires are getting crossed because there's two directories with the same name? 
- Also tested changing `tribe` to `tribe-events` since that was the fix in a different template path issue (I think for CE though)
