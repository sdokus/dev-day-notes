# Week of May 24

## Goals:
- [x] [x] [x] 3 PRs
- [x] [] 2 Docs
- [] Make changes to AJAX Demo Plugin
- [x] Write up ORM Docs Procedure
- [] roadmap.sh -> pick a concept (caching?)

## Notes
- For how to create the PR from the submitted request: 
  - You can use their branch by creating a new remote locally for you to work. 
  - `git remote add fork-jhsoby git@github.com:jhsoby/the-events-calendar.git`
  - then you look at the branch that person did by doing something like `git fetch fork-jhsoby`
    `git checkout -b issue/4585 fork-jhsoby/master`
    so you will get his master branch to point to your issue/4585
    if it doesnt let you commit directly, just close his PR and open a new open, and cherry-pick his hash
    so you would just `git push origin issue/4585` instead of `git push fork-jhsoby master` when trying to push the commits
