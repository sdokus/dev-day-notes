## Goals
- [x] Follow along with [recording](https://app.letsdive.io/standalone-agenda/agn_0f4141639f4c4e6395d2b0a7f7ae4292) and match steps to modularize plugin
- [x] Make `get_events_callback` its own class
  - [x] Separate out each function 
- [x] Settings for AJAX Logger
    - [x] Change to on/off switch and a save button


## Questions for Gustavo
- Why am I getting this error for namespacing?: "Namespace name doesn't match the PSR-0/PSR-4 project structure" - it looks like it wants the plugin to be named "Sdokus"
  - Is this why when I try to make a new class with the same process you demoed it doesn't know where to put the new file?
- Does the Ajax/Ajax_Callback follow standards for naming+? Or should the file just be 'Callback.php'?
- [x] How can I make the notification not show up on all pages? 
- Is there a better way to manage breaking up the Logger functions?k
- For the Workflow now in the TEC/support repo, it returns a 404 for some support folks - what permissions do they need to view it?
