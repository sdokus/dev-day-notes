# Notes

### Deets
- Dev site being weird again 
  - Asked in Slack here: https://lw.slack.com/archives/G01H7Q57P1C/p1706032620927639
  - Issue = even though I updated plugins in the "usual" way and they are showing as the updated version in the plugin tab and I can see all the updated files, none of the new functionality is showing. \
  - Troubleshooting attempted:
    - Flushed cache with `lando wp cache flush`
    - Tried `lando restart`
    - Tried `lando destory && lando start`
    - Restarted computer
    - Tried `lando destroy && lando start` again, now I'm getting this error but just on https:// -> `[ECONNREFUSED] CONNECT ECONNREFUSED 127 0 0 1 443`
      - Attempted to see what what happening on that port, seemed like there were _some_ things so I deleted them all and tried again, still an issue
      - Even though I was pretty sure Docker was not even running, I tried deleting everything in Docker and OrbStack and then destroying and restarting again and that did the trick
    - Updates still not showing though...
      - Figured out that everything was being highlighted bc I had PHPCS set to something other than StellarWP
      - Tried doing a debugger in a Series Passes file, didn't get caught when expected 
      - Created a single event and added a ticket and Lo I can see the "Single Ticket" with icon... but there was also a notice that if I upgraded to Pro I could get more ticket types 
      - The upsell notice is coming from the new series_pass.php file which is in the new files following the upgrade! It seems like it's being triggered because ECP isn't being recognized as activated (even though it is because I can make recurring events...)
      - Another clue is that the system info is different compared to a sandbox that's working as expected.
        - Tried checking out the database to see what might be happening to the wp_options table, and I'm seeing a connection refused error - but I think that's just a PHPStorm setting issue or something because DBeaver works fine
        - I looked at the DB and using phpMyAdmin the sandbox's db, but they both didn't have the `flexible_tickets_activated = 1` in the options table???
        - Tried using `lando wp shell` and then `tribe_get_option( 'flexible_tickets_activated');` but it's returning as true????
