## Notes
- I'm having an issue again where `pup build` ends up failing:
```txt
[FAIL] Build step failed: npm run build
Exiting...
Script @php bin/pup.phar handling the pup event returned with error code 9

[FAIL] Build step failed: cd common && composer -- pup build
Exiting...

```
- And I'm getting a fatal error that something is being redeclared (probably from having the dev versions checked out for more than 1 plugin)
- Steps To Troubleshoot:
  1. Update all plugins, making sure to include `--no-dev`
  2. That seemed to do the trick lol at least for the fatal error
