# GOAL: Explore slic

## Approach:

- Read through slic documentation
- Be able to install and configure slic on local set up
- Try to run some tests on master branch (should pass)
- Stretch goal: write tests for bug that start as failing and will only pass once the bug has been fixed

## Resources

- [Slic Repo](https://github.com/stellarwp/slic)
- [Codeception Docs](https://codeception.com/docs/Introduction)
- [Composer Docs](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)
- [wp-browser Docs](https://wpbrowser.wptestkit.dev/)

## Notes

- The slic (StellarWP Local Interactive Containers) CLI command provides a containerized and consistent environment for running automated tests.
- Slic configures a Codeception testing environment for you, which supports unit (pieces of code), functional (web requests), and acceptance (user perspective) tests
- _The links to [wp-browser](https://wpbrowser.wptestkit.dev/) are pointing to empty repos - seems like it's been moved to [here](https://wpbrowser.wptestkit.dev/)_
- Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP -> stored in the `/vendor` directory - very similar to node's npm
- wp-browser is a set of modules of middleware to further build off Codeception

## Using slic

### Set Up

1. You need to essentially activate slic in the scope that you want to use it - either in the plugins directory or the site's root directory by navigating to either of these locations and then running the command `slic here`
2. You can then run `slic info` to see the available "Valid Targets" of plugins you can run tests on
3. You then need to pick a project; for example to run tests for The Events Calendar plugin, you would run the command `slic use the-events-calendar`
4. Create containers in Docker for slic by running `slic start`
5. Initializes a plugin for use in slic by running `slic init the-events-calendar`
6. Now slic is ready and pointing at TEC and ready to run some tests.

### Running Tests

1. Codeception follows a specific directory structure to locate and run tests. By default, it looks for tests in the tests directory within your Codeception project. Here's a breakdown of the default directory structure:

```
project-root/
├── tests/
│   ├── acceptance/
│   ├── functional/
│   ├── unit/
│   ├── _bootstrap.php
│   └── _output/
├── codeception.yml
└── vendor/
```

2.  In the case of TEC, a lot of tests have been added to the /tests directory. To run the full test suite run `slic run wpunit` -> these tests are written in `wp-content/plugins/the-events-calendar/tests/wpunit`
3.  To run a specific test, you can run `slic run /path/to/test` - for example: `slic run tests/wpunit/functions/template-tags/SamTest.php`

### Writing Tests

1. In the `/tests/wpunit/functions/template-tags` directory create a php file
   _When I try to just add a file to `/tests` I get an error that the suite cannot be found - is this because a `.suite.dist.yml` file is needed for each new suite?_
2. At the top of the page add this code:

```
use Tribe\Events\Test\Testcases\Events_TestCase;

class SamTest extends Events_TestCase{
}
```

- This pulls the class `Events_TestCase` which extends Codeception's `WPTestCase` by adding the "factories" that let you build dummy events, organizers, and venues for testing purposes on top of all of the built in tests that are available through Codeception

3. The structure of a test is a _docblock_ with an explaination of what is being tested and the tag `@test` and then the _function_ with a descriptive name about what the expected behavior should be. Inside the function there can be any number of _assertions_

- Assertions are the tests built in to Codeception and you access it through `$this` - for example:

```
$this->assertEquals(1, 1);
```

4. Also within the `$this` variable are the factory functions to create different posts (including events, organizers, and venues) for testing purposes - for example:

```
        $this->factory()->event->create();
        $events = tribe_events()->per_page(-1)->count();

        $this->assertEquals(1, $events);
```

- Building dummy data for testing is important _(and definitely something I need to practice more to feel more comfortable doing)_
