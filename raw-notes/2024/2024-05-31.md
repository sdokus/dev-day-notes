# Creating a New Demo Plugin

## Process
### Set up initial files and `composer.json` and initialize git repo
1. Create a new directory in the plugins folder and then in that directory:
2. Add a file for the main plugin file 
3. Add a `composer.json` file - for a good baseline example, this is what I have:
```json
{
  "name": "sdokus/events-demo-attendee-list",
  "description": "A TEC Demo WordPress plugin by Sami Dokus",
  "type": "wordpress-plugin",
  "license": "GPL-2.0",
  "autoload": {
    "psr-4": {
      "Sdokus\\Attendee_List\\": "src/Demo_Attendee_List"
    }
  },
  "minimum-stability": "dev",
  "require": {},
  "config": {
    "preferred-install": "dist",
    "platform": {
      "php": "8.0"
    }
  }
}
```
4. In the command line run `composer install` - this will use the composer.json file to install dependencies and create the appropriate directories and files
5. I also added a `readme.txt` file and a `src` directory with a plugin folder and file for the main plugin class. 
6. I ran `git init` and then got a repo going
