## Approach:

[X] Install PHPStorm
[ ] Follow along with [this course](https://laracasts.com/series/how-to-be-awesome-in-phpstorm)
[ ] Add more detail to Self Evaluation
[ ] Adjust test to change a different setting than multiday cutoff

## Notes

- `cmd + 1` -> Toggle sidebar
- 'Symbols' = methods
- `cmd + ,` -> Bring up preferences
- Can add custom color schemes by adding `.icls` files to `~/Library/Preferences/WebIde80/colors`
    - One library can be found [here](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes)
    - Click on `Raw` for the theme that you want and copy the URL
    - In terminal, navigate to `~/Library/Preferences/WebIde80/colors`
    - Run the command `wget <URL you copied eariler>`
      Restart the editor and you should see the new theme as an option in your preferences
- `shift + cmd + A` -> Seach bar
- Changed keystroke to be `cmd + p` -> opens search for files
- Every tree view is filterable
- `cmd + r` -> show file structure, and then it can be filtered
- `cmd + option + o` -> find a method by name
- `cmd + â†‘` -> sets the current directory to whatever file is open
- `cmd + n` -> create new file or class, etc.
- `shift + shift` -> search actions
- Can create live templates for essentially creating macros/snippets for faster repeated code (episode 7)
- `cmd + option + l` -> reformat file
- `control + t` -> open refactor options
    - Can use these options to quickly and consistently rename or extract variables or change to inline
- _Question: Does TEC use the file templates that he's describing? Is that something I should reconfigure like he's
  walking through?_
- `option + return` -> can automatically import classes
- When getting to the section of setting up xdebug, I might be overcomplicating things because I already had xdebug set
  up but for VSCode?
