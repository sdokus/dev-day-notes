# GOAL: Deepen Understanding of WP CLI

## Approach:

- Import 2 customer websites into 2 new environments
- Use WP CLI to modify home URL so the site can be viewed locally
- Pull info from db
  - Events
  - TEC Settings
  - License Key (PUE)

## How to use a db dump to copy a site locally:

### Using database from customer (Modified from Victor)

1. Back up current database with command `lando wp db export backup`
2. Download the customer's database file and put in the root of an existing site. This is in the same default place where the wp-config.php lives
3. Run the command `lando wp db clean --yes` to delete all the existing tables for the site (don't worry, that's why you backed everything up!)
4. Run the command `lando wp db import [db_name].sql`
5. Run the command `lando wp db prefix` to see the prefix that the tables use. If it is different than `wp_` edit the wp-config.php file to match what it is
6. Using the following command as an example `lando wp search-replace 'http://customer-domain.com' 'https://stable-dev.lndo.site/'` to modify all database records to point to your local domain
   - If you're unsure of the site's domain, you can look in the wp_options table
7. If you don't have admin credentials for the site, use the following command to create your own admin user: `lando wp user create sam sam.dokus@theeventscalendar.com --user_pass=password --role=administrator --allow-root`
8. Go to 'https://stable-dev.lndo.site/' and log in with your admin user
9. Once you're done you can switch back to your database by following the same process but importing the backup database instead of the customer's

_Note:_ Plugins that were active on the production site that are not present on the local installation will get automatically deactivated when you navigate to /wp-admin/plugins.php. These can be imported and added to the wp-content folder by using one of the plugins listed in the Resources section above

### Pulling information from db using WP CLI

#### Option 1 - WP Shell

1. Run the command `lando wp shell` to open the WP Shell CLI
2. From here you can execute PHP commands, including `tribe_events()->per_page(-1)->count();`

#### Option 2 - WP CLI

1. Run the command `lando wp post list --post_type=tribe_events` to return a table of all the tribe_event post types (AKA all the events)
2. Run the command `lando wp post meta list <id>` to return all the meta for a given event
3. To return only a select few meta keys you can add `--keys=<keys>` to the above command
4. Piping and xargs can be used to take the output of these commands and then do something with them - for example: `lando wp post meta list 315 --keys=_EventCost --format=json | xargs echo {}` This can be a great tool for automating commands used often, or saving outputs to a file, etc.

#### Option 3 - Run SQL Queries

1. Run the command `lando wp db cli` to open a MySQL console
2. Run the SQL query `SELECT * FROM wp_tec_events;` to see the entire Events table
3. Run the SQL query `SELECT * FROM wp_tec_events WHERE start_date > NOW();` to see all upcoming events
4. Run the SQL query `SELECT * FROM wp_options WHERE option_name = 'tribe_events_calendar_options'\G` to see all the settings for The Events Calendar

### Using DBeaver to inspect the database

1.  Open DBeaver
2.  File > New > Database Connection
3.  Search and select 'MySQL'
4.  In the terminal, run the command `lando info` to see which port your external connection is running on
5.  In the DBeaver GUI, copy that port number and fill in 'database' 'username' and 'password' all with 'wordpress'
