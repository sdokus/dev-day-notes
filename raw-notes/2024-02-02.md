## Notes
- Helped Truman with a breakpoint issue (Huddled for 49 min)
  - Seems like we could narrow it down to the Avada Child Theme (probably a customization in there messing with the order of how the breakpoints should load)
  - Used Chrome Dev Tools to compare a working site (my dev site) and their test site
  - Narrowed down the issue to the container not being properly set, which results in the breakpoint defaulting to 'xsmall'
  - [Ticket](https://ithemeshelp.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/560304 )
  - [Slack Thread](https://lw.slack.com/archives/C01T0TSD4SC/p1706889837946709)
- Spent ~3 hours trying to get the `tribe_context` demo plugin working so the shortcode could dynamically accept the location key and output the correct location value based on the context
  - Got blocked because it seems like using AJAX to make the call from the AJAX call is returning null:
```php
$output = tribe_context()->get($locationKey); // returning null
```
