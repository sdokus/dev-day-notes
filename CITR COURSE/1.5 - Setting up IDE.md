# Setting up Your IDE

I originally wasn't going to take notes on this, but this is probably the thing that bothers me the most that I do the least about, so it would benefit me to take some time to get things right.

## npm
- Package manager for `Node.js`
- `npm` makes a command line tool, which allows you to run `npm run [script]` (along with other commands)
- We have a script `npm run lint` that I need to try out
- You can add to these scripts in the project's `package.json` file

## Prettier
- Tool to make formatting consistent
- Install globally with `npm install --global prettier` or at the project level with `npx prettier`
- This is where I get confused - our plugins have a `.prettierrc.js` file already... do we have Prettier already set up and configured for our plugins? Why do I still have formatting headaches?

# ESLint
- Linting enforces coding rules
- Looking at our `package.json` it looks like we have `eslint` for JS and `stylelint` for CSS
- There's also a whole `.eslintrc.js` file and it looks like there's a bunch of custom `tribe` configurations

# Vite
- This is the builder tool in this class, but for TEC we use Webpack.
