# Dev Day Jan 26

## Goals:
- [x] Add changes suggested by Juan to [this PR](https://github.com/the-events-calendar/event-tickets/pull/2900)
- [x] Keep going with last week's tasks related to AJAX plugin 
  - [x] Add methods that enables hooks and removes hooks
  - [x] Add DocBlocks for everything
  - [x] Add external CSS file 
  - [x] Tweak the functionality to be more useful regarding AJAX specific to TEC 

### Notes from Dev Day
- Methods that enable and remove hooks
  - Using [here](https://github.com/the-events-calendar/the-events-calendar/blob/3308afdb3c45bc20773ead9dda89baa7bca24323/src/Tribe/Main.php#L345) as a model
  - Reason for having a method for hooks/actions is to group/organize the hooks and control that they are initialized when the plugin is active 
  - Sorting through TEC as a model, but getting a bit lost in how things are bootstrapped together 
    - There's a whole `Tribe__Events__Deactivation` class (which extends an [abstract class](https://www.w3schools.com/php/php_oop_classes_abstract.asp) `Tribe__Abstract_Deactivation` )
    - Reading through everything it seems like this is only necessary to perform tasks such as setting default options, creating database tables, or cleaning up resources when a plugin is activated or deactivated.
      - Currently, my plugin does not do any of these things, so it feels okay to skip this 
- CSS
  - Need to research PostCSS more
    - Create a resources folder -> create a postcss directory
    - Compile the PostCSS into CSS by running gulp
    - PostCSS file structure seems to be complicated, but the benefit is that you can easily set up reusable variables
    - I think I _could_ keep digging into setting up PostCSS but I should probably focus more on the functionality of my plugin
    - For now, I'll just add a classic CSS file to style my button
- JS
  - Hurts my brain switching back to JS 

### Notes on Troubleshooting Dev Site Issue 
- Dev site being weird again 
  - Asked in Slack here: https://lw.slack.com/archives/G01H7Q57P1C/p1706032620927639
  - Issue = even though I updated plugins in the "usual" way and they are showing as the updated version in the plugin tab and I can see all the updated files, none of the new functionality is showing. \
  - Troubleshooting attempted:
    - Flushed cache with `lando wp cache flush`
    - Tried `lando restart`
    - Tried `lando destory && lando start`
    - Restarted computer
    - Tried `lando destroy && lando start` again, now I'm getting this error but just on https:// -> `[ECONNREFUSED] CONNECT ECONNREFUSED 127 0 0 1 443`
      - Attempted to see what what happening on that port, seemed like there were _some_ things so I deleted them all and tried again, still an issue
      - Even though I was pretty sure Docker was not even running, I tried deleting everything in Docker and OrbStack and then destroying and restarting again and that did the trick
    - Updates still not showing though...
      - Figured out that everything was being highlighted bc I had PHPCS set to something other than StellarWP
      - Tried doing a debugger in a Series Passes file, didn't get caught when expected 
      - Created a single event and added a ticket and Lo I can see the "Single Ticket" with icon... but there was also a notice that if I upgraded to Pro I could get more ticket types 
      - The upsell notice is coming from the new series_pass.php file which is in the new files following the upgrade! It seems like it's being triggered because ECP isn't being recognized as activated (even though it is because I can make recurring events...)
      - Another clue is that the system info is different compared to a sandbox that's working as expected.
        - Tried checking out the database to see what might be happening to the wp_options table, and I'm seeing a connection refused error - but I think that's just a PHPStorm setting issue or something because DBeaver works fine
        - I looked at the DB and using phpMyAdmin the sandbox's db, but they both didn't have the `flexible_tickets_activated = 1` in the options table???
        - Tried using `lando wp shell` and then `tribe_get_option( 'flexible_tickets_activated');` but it's returning as true???? 
    - Another blue team update came through so updating those plugins - got more errors! 
  - Working with Gustavo in our 1:1 we figured out that this was caused from the `stellarwp/codingstandards` being updated but the `composer.json` file in ET and ETP were not updated
    - Also potentially an issue was with how I was updating my plugins (not using `--no-dev`) and need to `stash` see below for new command to use

### Notes from 1:1 
- Get in the habit of using mouse as little as possible!
  - `cmd + shift + F` -> search files
  - `cmd + click` -> look up the stack to see where what you're clicking on is defined
  - `double click` -> when functions/variables are all underlined you can just double click to highlight the whole thing
  - Turn off the debugger with the tool bar to the top right 
    - Phone turns listener on/off
- When updating plugins, the php version of your site *needs* to match the platform php version in the plugin's `composer.json`  
- Key Concepts to review: Containers vs Providers and `action_register` -> the last one is something Luca built to check the `do_action` and hook together different checks 
- `tail -f wp-content/debug.log` -> way to see the most recent output from the debug log in the terminal 
- `git config --global alias.supdate "submodule update --init --recursive"` -> set up an alias git command `supdate` to automatically refresh to current repo (?)
- For updating plugins from repo, after `git checkout master && git pull`
  - If the plugin has common (TEC or ET):
   ` rm -rf composer.lock vendor && composer install --no-dev && git stash && cd common && rm -rf composer.lock vendor && composer install --no-dev && git stash && cd ..`
    Doesnt have common:
    `rm -rf composer.lock vendor && composer install --no-dev && git stash`
- The `--no-dev` is important because dev can only be pointing to ONE plugin at a time. If the `--no-dev` is not specified, this can cause issues
- Learned a lot about REST API 
  - Learning documented in [this ticket](https://ithemeshelp.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/556903)
  - Also posted in [Slack](https://lw.slack.com/archives/G01H7Q57P1C/p1706206358604149), just to practice asking questions there
- I temporarily turned off PHPCS highlighting! It was driving me a little craaaazy - but when I want to turn it back on it's PHPStorm > Preferences > PHP > Debug > Quality Tools
