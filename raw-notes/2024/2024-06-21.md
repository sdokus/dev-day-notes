## Reverting a specific file in git
1. Use `git log` to find the commit hash you want to revert to
2. Revert to that version with `git checkout [hash] -- [file(s)]`
3. `git add [files] && git commit -a`
4. `git push origin HEAD --force`

## Tribe Assets Notes
- Needed to switch the `boot` hook to only loading the demo plugin AFTER either ET or TEC was loaded to ensure that `tribe_asset()` was available
- In `Shortcodes/Controller.php` we no longer need an action hook to register the assets
  - OLD METHOD -> `add_action( 'init', [ Attendee_List::class, 'register_assets' ] );`
  - We no longer need to hook into `init`, we can directly call the `register_assets()` method here. 
- Within `tribe_asset()` we can name the action hook to enqueue the asset on as we register it (5th param)
  - Allows developers to unload. 
- `tribe_asset()` also allows you to localize variables right within the registration call.
  - You can add the data as a function, which saves on performance load and can be conditional. 

## `Tribe__Template` Notes
- Class that sets up templates and allows for template overrides 
- Seems to use global or local contexts and has variables and functions to navigate folders and themes 
- I think the "meat" of `Tribe__Template` is around L500 in `the-events-calendar/common/src/Tribe/Template.php`
  - Or is it the `template()` method?
