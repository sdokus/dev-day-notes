# Goal: Get AJAX Demo Plugin to finish line

## To Do
- **Wednesday - polish up `tribre_context()-get()` doc:**
  - [ ] Add notes about `get_locations()` ? (Or change that part of the code?)
  - [x] Add reference to example of how the context changes based on where `tribe_context()` is called
  - [x] Change keys section to be a table, formatting by plugin
  - [ ] Add examples to end of doc (all related to conditionally modifying a template)
    - [ ] event post type
    - [ ] event category
    - [ ] related series
  - In 1:1 with Andras we talked about doing a dev rant in a couple weeks to showcase this 

- **Thursday - focus on AJAX plugin:**
  - **Goal for plugin = print a specific AJAX call to the screen (specific to TEC)**
  - [x] Correct Namespace - use github handle for name
    - [x] src shouldn't be part of the namespace 
    - [ ] I wrote down "use composer instead" but I'm not sure what I mean by that
  - [ ] Make the same code be able to be enqueued in a widget and a shortcode
    - [x] Watch G's talk on Stellar__Assets
    - [ ] From previous notes: This will mirror DRY code process used in ECP shortcodes etc
      - What do I mean by this? Like use ECP shortcodes as a model? 
    - [ ] Switch plugin to use tribe_assets() instead of wp_enqueue
  - [ ] Have CSS and JS files be enqueued in separate files using tribe assets and conditionally enqueuing only if the widget or shortcode is on the page.

- **Friday:**
  - [ ] Look into gulp package.json - how should it be configured and how do I set that up?
      - For gulp, need a package.json associated for npm use 
  - [ ] Review composer and strengthen my understanding of the what and why of composer
  - [ ] Make those updates to the PR and then clone to a brand new repo for testing


## Notes
- Great example in actual code where `tribe_context()->get()` is used: `wp-content/plugins/events-pro/src/Tribe/Views/V2/Template/Title.php`
- `tribe_context_locations` is the [hook](https://docs.theeventscalendar.com/reference/hooks/tribe_context_locations/) where the locations are merged per plugin
-  Mark github PR suggestions as resolved so G is notified 

- Namespace
  - I like [this guide](https://wpreset.com/php-namespaces-wordpress-guide/)

Enqueing Assets: 
- `Stellar__Asset` 
  - More declarative way of enqueing files
  - Visibility / Usability / Timing
  - Register Early - allows others to hook into and modify assests more easily 
- WP built-in way:
  - `wp_register_script` and `wp_enqueue_script`
- `Tribe__Assets`
  - Static Singleton Factory Method // Class within TEC [doc here](https://docs.theeventscalendar.com/reference/classes/tribe__assets/)
  - Lots of methods available, though for my purposes I probably just need: 
    - register -> `tribe_asset( $origin, $slug, $file, $deps = [], $action = null, $arguments = [] )`
    - enqueue -> `tribe_asset_enqueue( $slug )`
  - Question is, _where_ do I replace the enqueuing in my plugin? Should I just replace the WP enqueuing I had?
