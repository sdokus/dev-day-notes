# GOAL: Install PHPStorm

## Approach:

- [X] Install PHPStorm
- [X] Follow along with [this course](https://laracasts.com/series/how-to-be-awesome-in-phpstorm)
- [X] Add more detail to Self Evaluation

## Resources

- [Lando + PHPStorm + XDebug](https://docs.lando.dev/guides/lando-phpstorm.html)

## Notes

- 'Symbols' === methods
- Can add custom color schemes by adding `.icls` files to `~/Library/Preferences/WebIde80/colors`
  - One library can be found [here](https://github.com/daylerees/colour-schemes)
  - Click on `Raw` for the theme that you want and copy the URL
  - In terminal, navigate to `~/Library/Preferences/WebIde80/colors`
  - Run the command `wget <URL you copied eariler>`
  - Restart the editor and you should see the new theme as an option in your preferences
- Every tree view is filterable
- Command keystrokes can be edited 
- Can create live templates for essentially creating macros/snippets for faster repeated code (episode 7)
- _Question: Does TEC use the file templates that he's describing? Is that something I should reconfigure like he's
    walking through?_
- For Xdebug configuration, the key was adding `/app` to the 'Preferences > PHP > Servers' configuration
