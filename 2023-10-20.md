# GOAL: Improve Dev Competencies 

## Approach: 
- [X] Catch up on notes from last week 
- [X] Test workaround from [this bug ticket](https://stellarwp.atlassian.net/browse/TEC-4948?focusedCommentId=116158&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-116158)
- [X] Continue `tribe_context` documentation and exploration

## Dev Day Things to Keep On Radar:
- [ ] Submit KB request for Kandence snippet
- [ ] Convert ticket flowchart to Mermaid.js file?
- [ ] ORM documentation?
- [ ] Tribe_Context documentation?
- [ ] Start prepping for dev rant? 

## Resources:
- [Dendron](https://wiki.dendron.so/) - Tool for improving dev day notes
- [Discipline Competencies](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/191TAXsvkFHxiypK3O_TCDFcKihMDUHmOt5rR6ca94YM/edit#gid=0)

## Notes
- Going back to my 'Context Tester' shortcode plugin
- Added at least my base understanding of  `tribe_context()` to the documentation draft -> the main overarching use and the available locations data
  - @todo - send to Matt or Gustavo for feedback
- Researched where `tribe_context` is actually used in the code base:
  - `/the-events-calendar/common/src/functions/template-tags/general.php:811`
    - This line is where the function `tribe_context()` is defined
    - This file has a bunch of global TEC functions, including one I just used to test the settings: `tribe_get_datetime_format()`!
    - Good to keep on radar - seems like a lot of these function could come in handy in the future 
  - Tested the output of `tribe_context()->get_orm_args();` by hooking into the `wp_footer` and checking out the home page, a single event page, and the calendar page
