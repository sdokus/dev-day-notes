# Goal: Get AJAX Demo Plugin to finish line

## To Do
- **Wednesday - polish up `tribre_context()-get()` doc:**
  - [ ] Add notes about `get_locations()` ? (Or change that part of the code?)
  - [x] Add reference to example of how the context changes based on where `tribe_context()` is called
  - [x] Change keys section to be a table, formatting by plugin
  - [ ] Add examples to end of doc (all related to conditionally modifying a template)
    - [ ] event post type
    - [ ] event category
    - [ ] related series
  - In 1:1 with Andras we talked about doing a dev rant in a couple weeks to showcase this 

- **Thursday & Friday - focus on AJAX plugin:**
  - **Goal for plugin = print a specific AJAX call to the screen (specific to TEC)**
  - [x] Correct Namespace - use github handle for name
    - [x] src shouldn't be part of the namespace
  - [ ] Make the same code be able to be enqueued in a widget and a shortcode
    - [x] Watch G's talk on Stellar__Assets
    - [ ] Switch plugin to use tribe_assets() instead of wp_enqueue
    - [ ] From previous notes: This will mirror DRY code process used in ECP shortcodes etc
      - What do I mean by this? Like use ECP shortcodes as a model? 
    - [ ] Research the process of setting up a widget
    - [ ] Have CSS and JS files be enqueued in separate files using tribe assets and conditionally enqueuing only if the widget or shortcode is on the page.
  - [ ] Look into gulp package.json - how should it be configured and how do I set that up?
      - For gulp, need a package.json associated for npm use 
  - [ ] Review composer and strengthen my understanding of the what and why of composer
  - [ ] Make those updates to the PR and then clone to a brand new repo for testing


## Notes
- Great example in actual code where `tribe_context()->get()` is used: `wp-content/plugins/events-pro/src/Tribe/Views/V2/Template/Title.php`
- `tribe_context_locations` is the [hook](https://docs.theeventscalendar.com/reference/hooks/tribe_context_locations/) where the locations are merged per plugin
-  Mark github PR suggestions as resolved so G is notified 
- Namespace Note: Don't have the unique identifier be all caps, it should just be the first letter 
- For the case of my plugin, I don't need to use `__construct` or check that it's in the WP environment, or use `private` declarations 
- Instead of commenting out code, use a scratch file by doing `Cmd + Shift + n` and then searching for php

- Namespace
  - I like [this guide](https://wpreset.c__om/php-namespaces-wordpress-guide/)

### Enqueing Assets: 
- `Stellar__Asset` 
  - More declarative way of enqueing files
  - Visibility / Usability / Timing
  - Register Early - allows others to hook into and modify assests more easily 
- WP built-in way:
  - `wp_register_script` and `wp_enqueue_script`
- `Tribe__Assets`
  - Static Singleton Factory Method // Class within TEC [doc here](https://docs.theeventscalendar.com/reference/classes/tribe__assets/)
  - Lots of methods available, though for my purposes I probably just need: 
    - register -> `tribe_asset( $origin, $slug, $file, $deps = [], $action = null, $arguments = [] )`
    - enqueue -> `tribe_asset_enqueue( $slug )`
  - Before the assets can be registered, the plugin file, plugin file path, plugin directory, and plugin url all need to be defined
    - (Lines 56 - 59 in `Plugin.php`)

### Functionality of Plugin:
- Ultimate goal of plugin is to print _something_ to screen... what is that something? 
  - Specific TEC AJAX call - should I pick one and work backwards? 
  - Seems like a lot of AJAX calls are used on the admin page... is it wrong that my current plugin is set up on the frontend? 
  - Reminder: AJAX is a way of processing HTTP server requests without reloading the page 
    - So what HTTP server requests can we create specific to TEC? 
    - Let's just make a button that grabs all the existing events in the db using the API 
- Eventually... refer to this [ticket](https://ithemeshelp.zendesk.com/agent/tickets/545879) where Eddie inspired this whole concept: 
```php
$pp_time = microtime(true);
$last_time = microtime(true);
$uuid = uniqid();

add_action('all', function() use($pp_time, $uuid, $last_time) {
	if(empty($_POST['action']) || $_POST['action'] != 'save-attachment') {
		return;
	}
	$ct = microtime(true);
	$delta = $ct - $last_time;
	$last_time = microtime(true);
	if(defined( 'DOING_AJAX' ) && DOING_AJAX && is_admin() && $delta > 3) {
	   error_log($uuid.'-'.current_filter().' '.microtime(true));
	}
});
```
