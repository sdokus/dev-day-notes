# Week of April 12th

## Goals
- Open at least 3 PRs for different functions in `the-events-calendar/src/functions`
    - Add links to references in functions
        - `@uses [path] [function-name]`
        - `@see [reference]`
    - Add return type if missing
    - Add params if missingblcok

### Steps for adding a PR to update decprecated functions
1. `cd` into the directory where you are changing a DocBlock
2. Look up what the next release branch is [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1m5xmULGTpqRAQzMG-pVT74Ub9AnSsOT87yGFz7toLTE/edit#gid=1365577016)
3. `git checkout [release branch]`
4. `git pull`
5. `git checkout -b <new-branch-name>` -> the branch name will likely be something like 'tweak/docblock-update-for-<function-you-are-updating>'
6. Make the edits to the docblock (DO NOT TRY TO TWEAK FORMATTING ISSUES - SIMPLE IS BETTER). Make sure you add a note to the `readme.txt`
7. `git add`
8. `git commit -m <message>`
9. `git push origin <new-branch-name>` -> this will prompt you with a link to open a PR - click it! 
10. Make sure the base branch is the release branch and add the appropriate labels and request CRs
