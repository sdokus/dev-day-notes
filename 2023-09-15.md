# GOAL: Explore slic

## Approach:

- Read through slic documentation
- Be able to install and configure slic on local set up
- Try to run some tests on master branch (should pass)
- Stretch goal: write tests for bug that start as failing and will only pass once the bug has been fixed

## Resources

- [Slic Repo](https://github.com/stellarwp/slic)
- [Codeception Docs](https://codeception.com/docs/Introduction)
- [Composer Docs](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)

## Notes

- The slic (StellarWP Local Interactive Containers) CLI command provides a containerized and consistent environment for running automated tests.
- Slic configures a Codeception testing environment for you, which supports unit (pieces of code), functional (web requests), and acceptance (user perspective) tests
- _The links to [wp-browser](https://wpbrowser.wptestkit.dev/) are pointing to empty repos_
- Composer is a tool for dependency management in PHP -> stored in the `/vendor` directory - very similar to node's npm

## Using slic

### Set Up

1. You need to essentially activate slic in the scope that you want to use it - either in the plugins directory or the site's root directory by navigating to either of these locations and then running the command `slic here`
2. You can then run `slic info` to see the available "Valid Targets" of plugins you can run tests on
3. You then need to pick a project; for example to run tests for The Events Calendar plugin, you would run the command `slic use the-events-calendar`
4. Create containers in Docker for slic by running `slic start`
5. Initializes a plugin for use in slic by running `slic init the-events-calendar`
6. Now slic is ready and pointing at TEC and ready to run some tests.

### Writing and Running Tests

1. To run the full test suite run `slic run wpunit` - the config file for these tests can be found in `plugins/the-events-calendar/tests/wpunit.suite.dist.yml`
