# AJAX Demo Plugin, Cont'd 

### Goals (by end of Jan):
- [ ] Create a single branch to add all the corrections to typos in docblocks
  - Only for branches correcting docblocks - if it were live code (not a comment) it would require different branches for each fix. 
- [x] Create repo for AJAX plugin 
  - First commit should just be a `readme`
- [x] End with a PR for Gustavo to review by next week
- [ ] Goal for plugin = print a specific AJAX call to the screen (specific to TEC?)
- [ ] Make the same code be able to be enqueued in a widget and a shortcode
  - This will mirror DRY code process used in ECP shortcodes etc. 
- [ ] Have CSS and JS files be enqueued in separate files using tribe assets and conditionally enqueuing only if the widget or shortcode is on the page. 
- [x] Use `namespace`s and `composer` for autoloading throughout the plugin


## Notes

- Why use composer? 
  - Dependency management (external libraries or packages)
  - Autoloading (classes are automatically loaded from installed packages)
    - Autoloading removes the need for _requiring_ each class across files

- Building Plugin
  - Used TEC as a model for how to modularize 
  - In future, could refactor by making a singleton class (like TEC and might avoid the issue with multiple shortcodes on the same page?)
  - Could use the file `the-events-calendar/common/src/Tribe/Ajax/Operations.php` for understanding TEC ajax calls
  - Understanding Tribe__Assets: `wp-content/plugins/event-tickets/common/src/Tribe/Assets.php`
