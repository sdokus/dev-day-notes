# GOAL: Tribe__Context 
- Create shortcode to print a different data for venue, organizers, and events (or none of the above) based on the context of the page

## APPROACH:
- Research how this is currently done in the code for things like different calendar views, organizer page, venue page, etc.
  - Note from Gustavo: There are multiple ways to do this, the ‚Äúright‚Äù way is the newer method that returns a WP Post Object, which has more information
- Write a shortcode (new or using the same plugin as before?) that outputs the data in response to the page it‚Äôs on
- The shortcode should be rendered in footer on page in a widget
- Make sure that there‚Äôs a parameter in the shortcode being passed to backend (venue, organizer, events (any or all of those) or none)
  - Entered as string, parse in backend
  - This I‚Äôm confused about because isn‚Äôt the point of tribe_context that you don‚Äôt need to pass a parameter, the class can ‚Äúread‚Äù the page to understand what info to output?

## NOTES:
- From 1:1 with Gustavo:
- Never merge PRs with master - master is always behind the upcoming release branch(es)
- Output Control Functions:
  - https://www.php.net/manual/en/ref.outcontrol.php
  - A way of creating a ‚Äúbucket‚Äù before sending the output to the browser
  - Using output control functions in PHP is a good practice because it allows you to manage and manipulate output data more efficiently and effectively than just using echo
  - These functions enable you to capture output before it's sent to the browser and perform various tasks on it, like buffering, caching, and filtering.
  - Most caching plugins use output control functions
- Using var_dump() within the ob_start() and ob_get_clean()
  - var_dump includes the type of each value/expression
  - Arrays and objects are outputted recursively with each value indented
- Research looking at how tribe_context() is used currently in the code:
  - Did a search through all files of ‚Äútribe_context‚Äù - turns out it‚Äôs used in a LOT of places - in passing I saw examples of checking on user preferences and determining the current state of the page (i.e. ->doing_ajax() )
  - Eventually I found /events-pro/tests/views_integration/Tribe/Events/Pro/Views/V2/Views and a bunch of tests - seems like a good place to see how tribe_context can be used to determine all the different views
  - Reading through the different files though, maybe not (older and more about building the test events through json files to test the views than using tribe_context for the output of the views (I think?)
  - Small side note: I‚Äôm seeing `tribe_context()->get()` and `->alter()` for examples of how it‚Äôs being used to read or write (respectively) - eventually I‚Äôd want to circle back to these methods!
- Felt like I needed some more direction - stepped back to remember the ultimate goal: create a shortcode to output the different data depending on the tribe_context
- Went to ChatGPT, and got it to generate an example shortcode.
  - In order to better understand what it generated, I‚Äôm going to add a second shortcode to my ‚ÄúContext Checker‚Äù plugin, with the tag [context_data]
  - First, I realized that within this plugin I could improve my naming conventions - I had named the callback function for my first shortcode just ‚Äòrender_shortcode‚Äô which doesn‚Äôt leave much room for creating another shortcode
  - Had a re-learning moment where I had to remember that this plugin uses singleton patterns, so I‚Äôm creating the shortcodes within the class Tribe_Context_Dev
  - Got slightly distracted because my Prettier Linter that I set up last week is not formatting things how I want and it‚Äôs bugging me - decided to let it go until I have dedicated time to fixing it
  - In the new shortcode, started by doing a var_dump of $context (instead of with the previous shortcode using $locations = $context->to_array();)
  - The new output is an object with 6 key-value pairs:
    1. override_locations (empty array)
    2. doing_ajax (NULL)
    3. doing_cron (NULL)
    4. request_cache (array with all the locations)*
    5. use_default_locations (TRUE)
    6. post_state (object(TEC\Common\Context\Post_Request_Type)#2098)
- _Turns out to_array() is a method within Tribe__Context to specifically return a dump in the form of an array of all the locations (I had thought this was a built-in global WP method)_
- The first part of the suggestion by ChatGPT is to check the context using a series of if statements to look at the location by using $context->is('organizer')
  - The is method is also within Tribe__Context
  - ‚ÄúConvenience method to get and check if a location has a truthy value or not (aka if it is there or not)‚Äù -> from docblock
  - Looking into this further though, I think ChatGPT might be wrong because maybe it‚Äôs trying to pull the ‚Äòpost_type‚Äô location, but even then there doesn‚Äôt seem to be an ‚Äòorganizer‚Äô post type
- Back to researching the existing code!
  - Poking around led me to ‚Äòtec_is_view()‚Äô function - tested out this code
  ```php
  $context = tribe_context();
  if ($context->is('tec_post_type')) {
  $current_view = $context->get('view', 'default');
  } else {
  $current_view = 'Not a TEC post type';
  }
  ```
  - Tested this on an organizer page and it worked to show ‚Äòorganizer‚Äô when var_dumping the $current_view! (but there was no footer widget on the organizer page, so that confused me but I just added the shortcode to the description of the organizer)
  - Also this is confusing because how is it using ‚Äòtec_post_type‚Äù since that‚Äôs not in the locations.php?
  - Did some more research with ChatGPT about the difference between the ‚Äòis‚Äô and ‚Äòget‚Äô methods
    - `is` returns a boolean for if the location has been set
    - `get` returns the value for that location key
  - The 'tec_post_type' is not a predefined location in the locations.php file, but it seems to be a custom location for checking if the current post type is a TEC (The Events Calendar) post type.
  - üîë it seems that the locations.php file does not contain ALL of the possible locations. This makes sense since it can both be read and WRITTEN, and I knew that adding more plugins added more locations
  - Did a search for tec_post_type and there‚Äôs a whole secret extra locations array!!! In Service_Providers‚Ä¶ what does service provider mean? Why keep it separate from the O.G. locations.php?
  - https://github.com/the-events-calendar/the-events-calendar/blob/c582758f351ce32132d1d73cb25a8f5a443c418c/src/Tribe/Service_Providers/Context.php#L275-L287
    - This is where the tec_post_type is defined - looks like the three post types are TEC, Venue, and Organizer (which is exactly what this shortcode is looking to parse out!)
    - So we know that this will only return ‚Äòtrue‚Äô if the post type is one of those three types above, so this can be our first if statement in the shortcode
  - But going back to Gustavo‚Äôs hint, this doesn‚Äôt return a WP Post Object, so I‚Äôm probably off‚Ä¶
  - Went back to the code and discovered that the Organizer View is only available with ECP and I had been searching only in TEC üòÆ‚Äçüí®
        Side Note: Seems like tribe_context is used for the prev and next URLs on the Organizer View


- Checked in with Gustavo again and he clarified that the WP Object Post comment is more related to what data should be returned once tribe_context is used to determine what page we‚Äôre on!
- With that info, wrote this shortcode, which seems to be working:
