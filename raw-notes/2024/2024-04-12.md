# Week of April 12th 

## Goals
- Open 10 PRs for different functions in `the-events-calendar/src/functions`
  - Add links to references in functions
    - `@uses [path] [function-name]`
    - `@see [reference]`
  - Add return type if missing
  - Add params if missing
- Write up checklist for PRs (so I make sure I don't forget stuff)
- Template Path PR 


### Notes
- Before starting my PRs, I'm having an issue with my master branch being flagged with:
` modified:   common (modified content)
  modified:   src/resources/postcss/utilities (new commits)
`
  - Using the command `git diff HEAD~1` I can see the changes but I don't understand how to reconcile there being differences between the HEAD and my local repo
  - *The solution to this is `git supdate` which recursively updates the repo*
- Attempted to create a PR just changing some notes in a docblock and I'm failing all tests. 
  - Feeling frustrated about my neediness when it comes to guidance for getting dev tasks done. 
  - Feeling stuck regarding tangible actions I can/should take to improve my skills or what I should prioritize. 
  - *Turns out I was failing all tests because I also changed the expected parameter type for the function, which was causing a fatal. Whoops!*
