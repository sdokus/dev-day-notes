# Event Tickets Plus Attendee Page Broken Down

This is the process that happens "under the hood" to calculate the numbers on the Attendee Summary Page:

`calculate_totals()`
1. Grabs all tickets for the given event
2. Loops through each ticket and:
    - Checks if it should be counted (by default, all tickets should be counted except for RSVPs)
    - Grabs from the current ticket object and adds them to the totals for the given event:
        - total paid
        - total pending
        - total cancelled
        - total refunded

`print_totals()`
Outputs the HTML that is the table we see on the Attendees Page.
This uses different methods than the ones in the Ticket Object.

sold = paid + pending
complete = paid + cancelled + refunded

issued = $ticket_totals[**sold**, available]

## Notes

### Situation 1: Ordered 5 tickets, meant to only order 2
    Need to go to Attendees Page and delete three of the 5 pending attendees to delete
    Need to ALSO go to WC order and edit the quantity from 5 to 2. Even though the attendees show as deleted in the order details, the quantity was still showing at 5

### Situation 2: Two tickets share capacity
