## APPROACH: 
- Continue using ChatGPT and the ‘Context Checker’ plugin to investigate how tribe_context changes in different places on a WP site.

## Tribe__Context Documentation Drafting:

### What is Tribe__Context?
- Tribe__Context is a class built into The Events Calendar code as a way to fetch values from various sources in a flexible and ordered manner, kind of like a table of contents and a way to bring some order to the chaos of a WordPress site. This provides a dynamic and versatile way to read values from different contexts and sources in the WordPress ecosystem.

### Examples of why/how to use Tribe__Context
- Let’s say that you wanted to execute some code, but only where the ‘post_type’ is ‘tribe_events’. You can do that with tribe_context()!
```php
// Get the current context object
$context = tribe_context();


// Retrieve the value of the "post_type" location
$post_type = $context->get( 'post_type' );


// Now you can use the $post_type variable to check if it's "tribe_event" or do other processing based on the post type.
if ( $post_type === 'tribe_events' ) {
// Do something specific for the "Event" post type.
// For example, you might want to display event-specific content or perform specific actions.
return 'This is an Event post type.';
} else {
// Do something for other post types or when the context location is not found.
return 'This is not an Event post type.';
}
```

- This is extremely versatile as you can change the location that the context pulls to any of the different variables available - in this example it was ‘post_type’, but you could also check the locations for other definitions:
  - post_id: Retrieves the ID of the current post (if available).
  - permalink_structure: Retrieves the permalink structure option from the WordPress settings.
  - plain_permalink: Checks if the permalink structure is empty to determine if it's a plain permalink.
  - posts_per_page: Reads and writes the number of posts per page (pagination) from and to various sources.
  - is_main_query: Determines if the current query is the main query on the page.
  - paged: Reads and writes the current page number for paginated queries from and to various sources.
  - page: Reads and writes the current page number from and to various sources.
  - name: Reads and writes the name/post_name of the current post from and to various sources.
  - post_type: Determines the current post type by analyzing the request URL.
  - single: Checks if the current query is for a single post.
  - taxonomy: Reads and writes the current taxonomy from and to various sources.
  - post_tag: Reads and writes the current post tag (or tag taxonomy) from and to various sources.
  - bulk_edit: Reads if the current request is for a bulk edit action.
  - inline_save: Checks if the current request is for an inline post save action.


## From ChatGPT:

Tribe__Context class is a utility class that represents a context state in the Tribe Events Calendar (TEC) plugin for WordPress. It manages a set of contextual data or "locations" that can be accessed and manipulated throughout the plugin. Each location corresponds to a specific data field or value relevant to the plugin's functionality.

### Key features of Tribe__Context:

Managing Context Locations: The class maintains a list of registered context locations, each associated with a specific data field or functionality.
Reading and Writing Locations: The class provides methods to read and write data to these context locations. The data can be accessed and modified throughout the plugin.
Filtering and Transforming Data: The class allows filtering and transforming data before reading or writing to the context locations, providing customization options.
Querying WP_Query Methods: The class includes methods to query the global WP_Query object to retrieve specific data from the current request.
REST API and AJAX Detection: The class can detect whether the current request is for the REST API, AJAX, or PHP-rendered initial state.
Checking Post Type Editing: The class can determine if the current request is an admin edit screen for specific post types.

### Example Use Case:

Suppose the Tribe Events Calendar plugin needs to manage various settings and configurations for events. Here's how Tribe__Context could be used in such a scenario:

Registering Context Locations: The plugin registers context locations like 'event_display', 'event_date', 'event_location', etc., to store information related to event display preferences, event dates, event locations, etc.

Reading and Writing Data: Throughout the plugin's functionality, different modules can access and modify these context locations. For example, a module responsible for displaying events on the frontend can read the 'event_display' location to determine the preferred event view (e.g., list, grid, calendar). It can also write to the 'event_date' location to filter events based on the selected date range.
Filtering and Transformation: Before reading or writing data to these context locations, filters can be applied to modify the data. For instance, a filter can be applied to the 'event_location' location to automatically format and validate the event location input provided by users.

Querying WP_Query Methods: When displaying events on a frontend list or grid view, the plugin can use query_method() to retrieve the relevant events from the global WP_Query object.

REST API and AJAX Detection: The plugin can use doing_rest() and doing_ajax() methods to differentiate between frontend and REST API or AJAX requests. This helps tailor the response accordingly.
Checking Post Type Editing: When editing event posts in the WordPress admin, the plugin can use the is_editing_posts_list() method to identify the relevant post types being edited and apply specific behavior or UI enhancements.

In summary, Tribe__Context serves as a central data manager for the Tribe Events Calendar plugin, allowing different parts of the plugin to communicate and share context-specific data effectively. It provides flexibility for developers to customize the behavior of the plugin based on the current context and user interactions.

### Summary with less jargon:
Tribe__Context is a tool used within the Tribe Events Calendar plugin for WordPress to manage and store different pieces of information related to events. It acts like a big container with labeled compartments, each holding specific details about events.

#### Here's a simplified explanation:

- Information Storage: Tribe__Context holds various pieces of information (like event display preferences, event dates, event locations) about events in separate compartments called "locations."
- Reading and Writing: Different parts of the plugin can access and change these compartments' contents. For example, one part of the plugin can read how events should be displayed (list, grid, or calendar view), and another part can change the date range of events shown.
- Customization: The plugin can adjust or modify the information before using it. For instance, it can make sure the event location is correctly formatted and valid.
- Using Query Results: When displaying events on the website, the plugin can ask for specific event information using simple queries.
- Differentiating Requests: The plugin can tell if it's responding to a regular visitor viewing the website or handling special requests like fetching data for mobile apps or other services.
- Enhancing Admin Experience: In the WordPress admin area, the plugin can provide additional features or improvements when editing events.
Overall, Tribe__Context helps organize and share event-related details among different parts of the plugin and makes it easier for developers to customize the event calendar's behavior and appearance.

### Explanation of how ‘location’ is used within Tribe__Context:

In Tribe__Context, a "location" refers to a specific key-value pair that represents a data point or a contextual variable. Each location has a unique identifier (key) associated with it, and its value can be retrieved or set using Tribe__Context methods. The purpose of locations in Tribe__Context is to provide a unified and organized way to store and access context-specific data.

Here's how the "location" concept works within Tribe__Context:

#### Defining Locations:
Locations are defined in the /Context/locations.php file, which contains an array of location definitions. Each location definition has a unique key, such as 'post_id', 'permalink_structure', 'posts_per_page', etc., which represents the specific data point being tracked.

#### Read and Write Operations:
Each location can have two types of operations: read and write. The "read" operation defines how the location's value is retrieved, and the "write" operation specifies how the value is set.

#### Location Sources:
Locations can have multiple sources from which their values can be retrieved. These sources include request variables (e.g., $_GET, $_POST, etc.), query properties (e.g., WP_Query properties), options (e.g., WordPress settings), or even custom callback functions.

#### Retrieving Location Values:
To retrieve the value of a specific location, you can use the get() method of Tribe__Context. When you call get('location_key'), it searches for the location with the specified key and returns its value.

#### Setting Location Values:
To set a new value for a location, you can use the set('location_key', $value) method of Tribe__Context. This allows you to store context-specific data that you might need later during the execution of your code.

#### Location Functions:
Some locations have associated callback functions that define how their values are computed. For example, a location might have a callback function that retrieves the current post ID when accessed. These functions provide a way to dynamically determine the value of a location.

#### Location Hierarchy:
If a location has multiple sources, Tribe__Context follows a hierarchy to determine the value to be used. For example, if a value is available from both a request variable and a query property, the request variable value takes precedence.

#### Default Values:
If a location is not found or its value is not set, you can specify a default value that will be returned when accessing that location. This ensures that you always get a meaningful value, even if the location is not available.

By using locations in Tribe__Context, developers can store and manage context-specific data in a structured and organized manner. It simplifies data retrieval, eliminates the need to directly access global variables, and promotes efficient and optimized data handling throughout the application. Locations serve as a key component of Tribe__Context's architecture, enabling flexible and consistent context management in WordPress development.
