# GOAL: Get Dev Site Working Again

### Background :
I was trying to test something for a support ticket and when I tried to test purchasing a ticket, there was a super buggy behavior where the attendees were never added to the Attendee List, but I could see the WooCommerce order. I tried testing on sandbox and it was not reproducible. 

In response to this I tried deleting and then re-downloading (via Github and the CLI) Event Tickets

Now I'm getting errors about a fatal happening when trying to activate ET and I think it's because the common.json file is not being pulled from github for whatever reason. 

## Notes:
- How to install a plugin via CLI and Github:
  - Go to GitHub and find the repo of the plugin you want to install 
  - Copy SSH 
  - In the terminal, navigate to the `/plugin` directory 
  - `git clone —recursive [SSH]`
  - `cd` to that plugin's directory
  - `slic use [plugin directory]`
  - Do each of these commands:
    1. `slic composer install` (** NOTE only do one plugin this way, all others `slic composer install --no-dev` ) —> for allowing testing
    2. `nvm use`
    3. `npm ci`
    4. `npm run build`
  - If there’s a `/common` directory in the plugin, `cd` into that directory and then `slic use [plugin directory]/common` and then repeat all the commands in step 7
- Maybe all of the above could be run in one line: `composer install && nvm use && npm install && npm run build`
  - Related Slack convo found [here](https://lw.slack.com/archives/C01SYM19N7K/p1654704588193069)
  - Yeah, that seemed to be the problem, running that one line in the main directory and in /common got the plugin installed and working!
