# GOAL: Set up Docker with 2 containers - a dev environment with the latest zips and a stable environment with the production plugin versions

## APPROACH:
- Read through Docker Documentation
- Docker Demo
- Read through Lando Documentation
- Set up two local dev environments

## Docker Documentation Notes:
- Docker Container = loosely isolated environment
- Docker uses a client-server architecture - server is called Docker daemon, and the client and daemon communicate using REST API
- Stealing their visual:
  - ![](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/images/docker-architecture.png)
- The Docker daemon (dockerd) listens for Docker API requests and manages Docker objects such as images, containers, networks, and volumes. (A container is a Docker object)
- Docker objects:
  - Images = read-only template with instructions for creating a Docker container. To build your own image, you create a Dockerfile with a simple syntax for defining the steps needed to create the image and run it. (Kinda like a class)
  - Containers = a runnable instance of an image. There is a docker container create command

- I followed the [demo](https://docs.docker.com/get-started) for how to containerize an application, and it was really helpful for breaking down how to create an image and then how to use that image. Specifically, I liked how they broke down each part of the command with what it was doing

- Image is created in a Dockerfile at the root directory
- `docker build -t getting-started .`
- `docker build -[flag tags] [name of image] [path to Dockerfile]`
- `docker run -dp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 getting-started`
- `docker run -[detach][publish] [HOST address]:[CONTAINER port] [name of image]`
- `docker ps`
  - command in a terminal to list your containers and their info
- ‚òÅÔ∏è _I skimmed the next section about sharing apps by pushing and pulling to a registry_
- Each container starts from the image definition each time it starts. While containers can create, update, and delete files, those changes are lost when you remove the container and Docker isolates all changes to that container.
- Volumes are a way to have data persist even when removing containers - By creating a volume and attaching (often called "mounting") it to the directory where you stored the data, you can persist the data.
- `docker volume create [name of volume]`
- Need to stop containers and rerun to add the ‚Äì-mount option and specify which volume to mount. In the example below the name of the volume is todo-db
- `docker run -dp 127.0.0.1:3000:3000 --mount type=volume,src=todo-db,target=/etc/todos getting-started`
  - the target (etc/todos) captures all files created at the path
- NOTE: instructions were to remove that container and then start a new container BUT when starting a new container you need to still specify to run with the volume in order for the data to persist
- Bind Mounts - Volumes can either be mounted or binded (which uses nodemon to watch for file changes and then restart the app automatically)
  - `docker run -it --mount type=bind,src="$(pwd)",target=/src ubuntu bash`
  - After running the command, Docker starts an interactive bash session in the root directory of the container's filesystem.


### Multi-container Apps
- By default, containers are isolated and do not ‚Äútalk‚Äù to one another, but you can change that by putting multiple containers in the same network
- 2 ways to do this: 1) assign the network when starting the container or 2) connect an already running container to a network
- Create the network: docker network create todo-app
- The demo then creates a new container in this network using the command below and then sets up MYSQL in that container:
```CLI
docker run -d \
--network todo-app --network-alias mysql \
-v todo-mysql-data:/var/lib/mysql \
-e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=secret \
-e MYSQL_DATABASE=todos \
mysql:8.0
```
- NOTE: each container has its own IP address

- ‚òÅÔ∏è The demo was super helpful for better understanding how Docker works and how to manage containers, though I also need to wrap my head around how Lando plays into all of this‚Ä¶
- ‚òÅÔ∏è Also wondering if there are TEC Docker images that exist that I should plug into or if that was part of what I set up early on without knowing it

### Lando Documentation Notes
- Tool to skip directly using all the steps above, AKA ‚Äúlocal development dependency management and automation tool‚Äù AKA an abstraction layer to set up Docker environments
- This [guide](https://docs.lando.dev/getting-started/what-it-do.html) walks through the lando.yml file
- Services are simplified but still highly configurable Docker containers. (!!!) that makes sense now!
- `lando init` is the command when first setting up lando, write it‚Äôs own lando.yml file
- `lando start` - Using the recipe set up in the lando.yml file, behind the scenes Lando is managing the containers, persistent storage, and the networking for the containers to communication with each other.
- [Tooling](https://docs.lando.dev/lando-101/lando-tooling.html) can be used to add commands to the lando CLI (i.e. phpcs can be set up to be run like lando phpcs index.php )

### Creating two dev sites (stable-dev and test-dev)
- Adjusted current dev site to become ‚Äústable dev‚Äù site
  - Needed to adjust the name and proxy to reflect change
  - Also changed the name in launch.json
  - lando rebuild -y (led to that no such proxy error again, ended up destroying and then lando start and now it‚Äôs up and running üòÄ)
- Created brand new ‚Äútest dev‚Äù site
  - Added TEC plugin zips pulled using tec-bot to follow the same process as QA and dev team
