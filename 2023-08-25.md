# GOAL: Improve troubleshooting with dev site

## APPROACH:
- Destroy lando/docker, tear everything to the ground
- Rebuild everything

## Process:
```CLI
lando destroy
docker system prune -a
docker volume prune
lando rebuild
```

- Ran the commands above and everything seemed to be working, including debugger
- Site was super slow though (30 seconds+ per page load)
  - Looked into Docker ORB https://orbstack.dev/ per Luca‚Äôs suggestion
  - Downloaded OrbStack, but when I clicked on ‚Äúmigrate Docker‚Äù it gave an error message
  - Trying to run lando start results in 404 or `ECONNREFUSED` errors
  - Tried to `destoy` and `rebuild` Lando and Docker again, no change
  - Tried deleting and then reinstalling OrbStack, error changed to 500  
  - Tried restarting computer, no change
  - Tried deleting all containers in OrbStack and Docker, but the Docker ones are still showing
    - Found that using the command docker ps -a shows all active containers and their status, and that is currently showing as empty (even though the desktop window is showing them still - their status is ‚ÄòExited‚Äô but they‚Äôre still there)
  - Did a `lando rebuild` and now everything seems to be working again üò≠ 
- Once dev site was working, I repeated the troubleshooting process for this ticket and updated the Jira ticket with my documentation for that
- Then I will admit I got distracted with my overdue tickets for 1-2 hours but then I remembered it was Friday AKA Dev Day and I refocused!
- With the rest of the day I fixed my Prettier linter because the notice was driving me a little crazy
- Used ChatGPT to help me sift through the readme(s) quickly
