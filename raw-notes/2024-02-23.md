# Dev Days Feb 21 - 23

## 1:1 Notes

- Use smaller, more recent plugins as model when possible 
- composer and namespace (using autoloader, using composer, bootstrap file, registering class properly)
  - can ignore dependencies, grunt, package.json for now
- how WordPress loads a plugin (i.e. only load after certain checks, have our actions only triggered by something within plugin)
- Flow of AJAX 
  - Right now using API 
  - Eventually, add my own (i.e. weather events for a given city)
  - admin-AJAX vs REST end point 

This week:
- REST API and AJAX working - tag G again on PR when feeling ready 
  - WP AJAX versus WP API - want both to respond to the AJAX call in JS 
  - Title and date - print same thing from either AJAX or API 
    - Something we do on the views - can use as hint? 
- Document as I go - DocBlocks, use todos, versions and since TBD, action and apply_filters (just like it was a function)
  - Use EA or EWP for models 
- Make sure using translations for anything being printed to screen
  - Read this: https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/
- Attempt to clone and reinstall repo 
- Next steps -> authentication with AJAX or REST API and difference between the two 
  - Create own REST endpoints 
  - Docs Site and Extensions workflow (-> github action)
