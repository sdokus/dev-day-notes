# GOAL: Practice Writing Tests

## Approach:

- Read through documentation for Codeception
- Write a test class that:
  - Creates an event using the ORM
  - Changes some TEC settings
  - Tests for how the event is affected
  - Teardown the event

## Resources

- [Codeception Unit Tests](https://codeception.com/docs/UnitTests)
- [Codeception Commands](https://codeception.com/docs/reference/Commands) _confused about how to use while using slic_
- [Assertions](https://docs.phpunit.de/en/8.5/assertions.html)
- [Annotations](https://docs.phpunit.de/en/8.5/annotations.html)
- [SetUp and TearDown](https://docs.phpunit.de/en/8.5/fixtures.html#more-setup-than-teardown)

## Notes

- [Namespace](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.namespaces.php) is an important part of tests because they help to avoid naming collisions across files and other PHP classes/functions/constants.
  - A file containing a namespace must declare the namespace at the top of the file before any other code
  - Essentially all about scope and being able to call different files and their classes through aliases
  - When importing using the `use` keyword, it needs to be in the outermost scope of the file (AKA not within a function). This is because the importing is done at compile time and not runtime, so it cannot be block scoped.
  - Without any namespace definition, all class and function definitions are placed into the global space - as it was in PHP before namespaces were supported. Prefixing a name with \ will specify that the name is required from the global space even in the context of the namespace.
- When writing tests, the number of variables created and used is important to consider for performance reasons - there usually is no reason to create more than 3 variables at a time

### Setting up a test

- If slic is not already set up and ready, navigate to the /plugin directory and run:
  - `slic here`
  - `slic use the-events-calendar`
  - `slic start`
  - `slic init the-events-calendar`
- Create a new file in `wp-content/plugins/the-events-calendar/tests/wpunit/TEC/Events` with the name of your testing class
- Declare the namespace `\TEC\Events` and import `Events_TestCase`:

```php
<?php

namespace TEC\Events; // lets slic know the context of the file when running the tests

use Tribe\Events\Test\Testcases\Events_TestCase; // allows new test class to extend Events_TestCase, which extends Codeception's `WPTestCase`
```

- Declare the class where your unit test will go. Unit tests are focused around a single component of an application:

```php
class SamTest extends Events_TestCase {}
```

### Build Test Data

- All external dependencies for components should be replaced with test doubles - this way when things change within the code there is some consistency within the tests.
- `setUp()` is where you create the objects against which you will test and `tearDown()` is where you clean up the objects against which you tested
- Can use existing tests in TEC as an example -> `plugins/the-evens-calendar/common/tests/wpunit/Tribe/Utils`
- Example:

```php
class SamTest extends Events_TestCase
{
    protected $event_test; // Keep variable in scope of SamTest Class so it can be accessed as $this->event_test

    function setUp(): void // This will be run before every test
    {
        parent::setUp(); // Runs the setUp() function imported from Events_TestCase

        // Create an event using The Events Calendar ORM before each test
        $event_data = [
            'title' => 'Sample Event',
            'content' => 'This is a sample event description.',
            'start_date' => '2023-09-23 10:00:00',
            'end_date' => '2023-09-23 12:00:00',
        ];

        $this->event_test = tribe_events()->set_args($event_data)->create();
    }

        function tearDown(): void // This will be run after every test
    {
        // Delete the event after each test
        if ($this->event_test) {
            tribe_events()->delete($this->event_test->ID);
        }

        parent::tearDown(); // Runs the tearDown() function imported from Events_TestCase
    }
}
```

### Writing Tests

- After the event data is set up to be created and then deleted after each test you need to write some tests!
- Tests use [assertions](https://docs.phpunit.de/en/8.5/assertions.html) - the most common ones are:
  - `$this->assertEquals()`
  - `$this->assertContains()`
  - `$this->assertFalse()`
  - `$this->assertTrue()`
  - `$this->assertNull()`
  - `$this->assertEmpty()`
- Example:

```php
 /**
     * @test
     * Should create an event before every test
     */
    public function should_create_a_new_event()
    {
        // Use assertions to check if the event was created successfully
        $this->assertGreaterThan(0, $this->event_test->ID);
    }

    /**
     * @test
     * Should be able to change aspects of test event
     */
    public function should_be_able_to_change_event_details()
    {
        // tribe_events()->where('ID', $this->event_test->ID)->set('title', 'Changed Event Title')->save();
        $this->event_test->title = 'Changed Event Title';
        $expected = 'Changed Event Title';
        $actual = $this->event_test->title;
        $this->assertEquals($expected, $actual);
    }


    /**
     * @test
     * If unchanged in the test, the Event Title should be 'Sample Event'
     */
    public function should_not_have_changes_persist()
    {
        $expected = 'Sample Event';
        $actual = $this->event_test->title;
        $this->assertEquals($expected, $actual);
    }
```
