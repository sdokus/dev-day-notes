# GOAL: Continue Practicing Tests

## Approach:
- [ ] Confirm slic is running properly after switching to PHPStorm
- [ ] Switch test of how settings affect calendar from looking at Multiday setting to Date/Time format

## Resources

- 

## Notes

- Refresher on starting slic:
  - In the plugin directory run: 
    - `slic here` // tell slic how to find your project
    - `slic use the-events-calendar` // points to where you'll be running tests
    - `slic init`
  - `cd the-events-calendar`
  -  - `slic init the-events-calendar` // sets up slic for TEC in the Docker containers
  - `slic run [path/to/test]`
- For the tests that I set up: `slic run test/wpunit/TEC/Events/SamTest.php`
