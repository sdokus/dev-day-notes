# Dev Days Feb 21 - 23

## 1:1 Notes

- Use smaller, more recent plugins as model when possible 
- composer and namespace (using autoloader, using composer, bootstrap file, registering class properly)
  - can ignore dependencies, grunt, package.json for now
- how WordPress loads a plugin (i.e. only load after certain checks, have our actions only triggered by something within plugin)
- Flow of AJAX 
  - Right now using API 
  - Eventually, add my own (i.e. weather events for a given city)
  - admin-AJAX vs REST end point 

This week:
- REST API and AJAX working - tag G again on PR when feeling ready 
  - WP AJAX versus WP API - want both to respond to the AJAX call in JS 
  - Title and date - print same thing from either AJAX or API 
    - Something we do on the views - can use as hint? 
- Document as I go - DocBlocks, use todos, versions and since TBD, action and apply_filters (just like it was a function)
  - Use EA or EWP for models 
- Make sure using translations for anything being printed to screen
  - Read this: https://developer.wordpress.org/plugins/internationalization/
- Attempt to clone and reinstall repo 
- Next steps -> authentication with AJAX or REST API and difference between the two 
  - Create own REST endpoints 
  - Docs Site and Extensions workflow (-> github action)

### Wednesday, Feb 21
- [x] Documentation of all functions, actions, filters, variables
- [x] Making sure anything printed to the screen is translatable
- [x] Right now I have a button that does a REST API call, and I need to clean that up a bit to only return the title and date of the first 10 events
- Used this as a model: https://theeventscalendar.com/knowledgebase/introduction-to-the-events-calendar-rest-api/ 

### Thursday, Feb 22
- [x] I should change the other button (currently creates a "test" WP AJAX call) to create a WP AJAX call that uses the ORM on the server side and returns that json object to the frontend to print the same info as the REST API call

### Friday, Feb 23
- [x] Internationalize JS file as well 
  - Add `.pot` file eventually (?) 
- [ ] Make sure the plugin is only enqueued if the shortcode is present 
  - Stuck because there's an error _somewhere_ in the tribe_asset() call
    - G suggested changing the action to `'wp_enqueue_scripts'` and when that didn't help inspecting the `$this` object 
- [ ] Make the code available as a widget and a shortcode
  - Widget Notes
- [ ] Test that composer is set up correctly by simulating copying the repo as a new project
