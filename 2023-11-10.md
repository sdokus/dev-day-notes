# GOAL: Dev Rant, WP-CLI Presentation Prep, and ORM Documentation

## Approach: 
- [X] Attend Luca's Dev Rant on Performance
- [ ] Make simple edits to ORM docs (formatting, etc)
- [ ] Start building examples for ORM usage 

## Notes:

### Luca Dev Rant on Performance:

#### Most common roots of slow performance:
 - Slow queries
 - Low memory
 - "Piggy backing" HTTP requests or CRON

#### STEPS FOR APPROACHING PERFORMANCE ISSUES:
  - 1 ) Is the issue consistent or intermittent? 
    - Intermittent: probably an issue with either cache or CRON
    - Consistent: probably an issue with slow queries, HTTP request, or "stupid code"
  - 2 ) Simplify scenario 
    - If intermittent, ask customer to disable cache and CRON (note that there can be 2 CRON systems - WP CRON and custom)
    - If consistent, reduce per page parameters (i.e. how many events show at a time in the dashboard)
  - 3 ) When reporting findings to a dev, don't say "performance" - use the words "unexpected behavior" or "bug" 


### Editing the ORM Documentation
- For each argument:
  - Remove the example
  - Make the type formatted as `code`
  - If applicable, link the options to other documentation 
- Eventually, create a separate sub-page that will be linked to for an example that showcases a real-life example where using the ORM for each argument can be used
  - For these, make sure to test each one extensively
