# Cannot get additional fields to show on dev site

## Troubleshooting Steps Taken so Far
- Confirmed that this is working on a sandbox (but can't fully use bc I don't have a way to debug), but the template override is not working
- Confirmed that this is working on my other local site (but can't fully use that because my debug isn't working)
- Tried both 2021 and 2024 themes on my dev site, either one will not show the additional field on event's frontend 
- Tried adding the additional field in classic editor and then switching to block editor, as soon as I switched they disappeared
- Looked at db and although I can see `<!-- wp:tribe/field-ecpcustom2 /-->` in the post_content, it's not appearing in the post_meta
  - But maybe actually it is there for one Block Editor event??? I need to return to this.
