## Creating a PR from a submission outside of LW from Stephen:
> I think it's small enough you can just re-create it.
> I'd treat this as a PR from an non-TEC person to establish "good habits":
> ref the original PR in the new one's comments
> add a readme entry - that references the ticket
> props to the outside contributor in the readme entry
> close the original PR when you open the new one and drop a note for the author pointing them to the new PR so they can watch it
