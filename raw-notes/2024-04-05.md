# Week of April 5 2024

## Goals 
- [x] Get AJAX Logger Admin to UI Standards
- [x] When saving the setting, add checks for permissions and nonces
- [x] Separate out `render()` and `save()` methods
- [x] Switch DB application to SequeliACE 
- [x] Add note to ORM documenation about bugs for `save()`
- [x] Make PR changes  
- [ ] AJAX Logger functionality
    - [x] Only listen and then log if setting is "on"
    - [ ] Output should create a new file (named `ajaxlog-[action-triggered]-[exact-date-of-state].json`)

## Bonus

    - [ ] Descriptions for how to use
    - [ ] Add more parameters to play with to demonstrate AJAX calls?
    - [ ] Is there a way to dynamically show the ORM or API call being built?

- [ ] ORM Presentation Follow Up Actions
    - [ ] Event status meta
    - [ ] Additional Fields Query
    - [ ] WP CLI + ORM 
- [ ] Try to find a simple bug ticket I can do a PR for (like changing the doc block template paths again)
