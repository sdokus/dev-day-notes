# Brainstorming 2025 

## Goals for 2025:
- Regular MR PRs
- Understand and write better tests
- Build JS-30 plugins for practice / holistic implementation
- Finish the ORM documentation :sob: 
- Delegate SuppSupp / build better systems for support to get help 
- Come up with more cohesive/organized note system 
  - Document issues and troubleshooting steps 
  - More visual notes? 
  - More regular note taking? 


## What did I work on today?
- I learned about how zip testing works 
  - Test Rails 
  - More manual than I had expected
  - Some plugins (ETP) had 87 tests that need to be MANUALLY tested for both the min and latest versions of PHP and WP 
- SuppSupp --> 
  - [Here](https://lw.slack.com/archives/C01SBD5T03V/p1737576460776419) good debugging to narrow down that the issue is related to memory exhaustion, and then Andras took it across the finish line to cleanup the meta data
- Tried to get PHPStan working for a PR but ran into issues (seems to not recognize `Tribe` classes) - good learning was reaching out for help sooner rather than later
  - Hopefully meeting with Stephen or Dimi later this week 
- Spent some time trying to pick out another MR ticket for antman:
  - https://stellarwp.atlassian.net/browse/TCMN-177 (this is the one I already have a PR going)
  - https://github.com/the-events-calendar/the-events-calendar/pull/4870 - Community submitted PR, seems simple and ORM oriented
  - https://stellarwp.atlassian.net/browse/GTPLAN-99 - Masood already opened a [PR](https://github.com/the-events-calendar/event-tickets/pull/3012) that also seems simple, seems like an easy win 
  - https://stellarwp.atlassian.net/browse/FBAR-294 - I haven't played in FBAR so much yet so could be interesting
    - Started to look into this one more in `wp-content/plugins/events-filterbar/src/Tribe/Filters/Additional_Field.php` 
  - https://stellarwp.atlassian.net/browse/ECP-1268 - There are 3 Day View bugs, so focusing here could be a many birds one stone situation
