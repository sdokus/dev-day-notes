# Release Process Notes

## This is my current understanding of the _entire_ release process:
    1. The POs/PMs add tickets to a sprint based on priority 
    2. The Engineers merge PRs to a release branch (or bucket branch if it's not determined yet which release it will be a part of)
    3. QA Hand off:
        - Individual Ticket Testing 
        - Regression Testing
        - Smoketest :question: not sure what this is :question: 
    4. Once the previous release has been finalized, if you are the release owner 


## Questions
    - Is the release board accurate / are people actually updating things as they do them?
