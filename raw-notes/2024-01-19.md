## Notes

### PR Process
- I am in a fight with tec-bot codesniffer! Everything I try it is rejected and I truly do not understand what I'm doing wrong, I need to just walk away
  - Gustavo got back to me that the issue is that although I mistakenly just added a space the root of the issue is with the original code and that's why changing it back to that is not stopping it from getting flagged!

### TEC Coding Standards
- CSS 
  - The CSS within The Events Calendar plugins built/transformed with [PostCSS](https://github.com/postcss/postcss).
  - There are PostCSS files (`.pcss`) in `src/resources/postcss` 
  - These need to be complied into CSS by running `gulp` and using a number of [PostCSS plugins](https://docs.theeventscalendar.com/developer/code-standards/css/#postcss-plugins)
- HTML
  - WAI-ARIA = accessibility by semantically describing the role of different HTML
  - We must be sure to add `rel="noopener noreferrer"` to anchor tags that make use of `target="_blank"`.
- JS
  - Variables that point to a jQuery object should have their name prefixed with a `$` sign
  - Utility functions, state, tests, and options for the main plugins should be stored in `tribe-events.js` and `tribe-events-pro.js`.
- PHP
  - The closing `?>` tag MUST be omitted from files containing only or ending in PHP
  - [Namespace Standards](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/#3-declare-statements-namespace-and-import-statements)
  - Classes should be named with The Events Calendar namespace (“TEC”), the plugin namespace (“Events”), and then the classname. Those three parts should be separated by double underscores (which will translate to directory slashes in the autoloader). Since we’re using double underscores as namespace separators, you can (and should) use single underscores in the class names.
    - _This is what I need to follow when refactoring my AJAX Inspector plugin_
  - Use `public static` instead of `const` when declaring properties to allow for easier deprecation later on
  - Whenever you create a global function, be sure to run `apply_filters()` on the result before it’s returned
  - As a rule of thumb, any `add_action()` or `add_filter()` calls should be contained inside a `hook()` method and should not be setup from within the constructor.
  - [How to Deprecate](https://docs.theeventscalendar.com/developer/code-standards/wordpress/#how-to-deprecate)
    - _Maybe this is something I can start doing regular PRs for_
- FILE STRUCTURE
  - PHP Class Files = `Class_Name.php`
  - Javascript Files = `some-descriptor.js`
  - [Directory Structure](https://docs.theeventscalendar.com/developer/plugins/file-structure/#directory-structure)
    - _compare current plugin structure to this and make sure I'm matching_
- GIT
  - The naming convention for new branches should be as such: `<feature|fix>/<ticket number>-<brief-description>`
  - Every single changelog has the following format: `* Type - Short description (props if applicable) [TICKET-123]`
    - NOTE: the description does not have a full stop period
  - Add `code review` label to PR (and `needs release` ?)
  - Once the code is approved, typically the person who made the PR merges and then deletes the branch and then updates the JIRA ticket

### Building Patterns (Singleton and Factory)
#### Singleton Pattern
  - Class that only allows one instance at a time
  - Accessible globally, which is great for managing state 
  - In TEC, it looks like this is where the settings are set up (makes sense since it should only exist as one instance)
    - Also seems like this is where Venues and Organizers are really tied to Events

### Composer and Autoloading
- Dependency management (external libraries or packages)
- Autoloading (classes are automatically loaded from installed packages)
  - Autoloading removes the need for _requiring_ each class across files
  - More info [here](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-4/)
- PSR-4 is the key where you define a mapping from namespaces to paths, relative to the package root
