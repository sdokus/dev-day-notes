# GOAL: Continue Practicing Tests

## Notes

- Also had performance review
- Refresher on starting slic:
  - In the plugin directory run: 
    - `slic start`
    - `slic here` // tell slic how to find your project
    - `slic use the-events-calendar` // points to where you'll be running tests
  - `cd the-events-calendar`
  -  - `slic init the-events-calendar` // sets up slic for TEC in the Docker containers
  - `slic run [path/to/test]`
- For the tests that I set up: `slic run test/wpunit/TEC/Events/SamTest.php`
- 
- I kept getting an error `[Error] Call to undefined method Codeception\Util\ReflectionHelper::getClassFromParameter()` and I finally [sought help in the #tec-dev channel](https://lw.slack.com/archives/G01H7Q57P1C/p1696972710384309) and George came to my rescue:

> From within your the-events-calendar directory:
rm -rf composer.lock
Then, cd into the-events-calendar/common and:
rm -rf vendor
git checkout -- vendor
composer install --no-dev
Now, go back up one dir to the the-events-calendar directory again, and:
rm -rf vendor
git checkout -- vendor
composer install
Note how in /common, it's composer install with --no-dev, but in the plugin dir it's just composer install. That's intentional!

- Note to self: ask for help earlier! Spent *way* too long trying to figure things out on my own - ask for help sooner next time!!!
