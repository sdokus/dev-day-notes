# Week of June 28

## Troubleshooting slic

- The error I'm seeing is `bash: line 1: vendor/bin/codecept: No such file or directory`
- I've already tried:
    - Restarting slic
    - Reinstalling composer (with and without dev)
        - I noticed that the `/bin` directory is only visible when I `composer i` and _don't_ include the `--no-dev`

## New site issue

```
Fatal error:  
Uncaught Error: Failed opening required '/app/wp-content/plugins/the-events-calendar/src/Tribe/Main.php' 
(include_path='.:/usr/local/lib/php') in /app/wp-content/plugins/the-events-calendar/the-events-calendar.php:73
```

- I have a feeling this is related to something I'm missing in git
- I did a bunch of combinations of `npm run build`
  and `rm -rf composer.lock vendor && composer install --no-dev && git stash`
    - I know that the order matters so I thought that was the issue, but nothing was fixing it
- Finally I restarted my computer and now it's working... just kidding after 5 minutes I'm getting the same error
- I believe that this ultimately was that there was an update from OrbStack that I was ignoring - Once I updated
  OrbStack everything is working again

## Expanding Dimi's PR

- Steps for testing
    1. Checkout PR branch `feature/changelogger`
    2. In terminal, run `npm install` -> this will add all the changes added in the new files
    3. Run `composer install` -> this will install the new dependencies added 
    4. Run `npm run changelog` -> This will create a new changelog file, with prompts for each required section.
    5. Look at the generated changelog in the new `/changelog` directory.
    6. Test adding a second entry and see that it makes another, separate file.
    7. Test generating the changelog with the
       command `./bin/process-changelog.sh 6.5.7 6.5.2 generate "2024-06-28"` -> `[file with command] [new version number] [old version number] [action type] [today's date]`
        - Worth noting that the readme.txt is only updated when the versions match, expect in this case the only change
          it made was deleting the header from the readme.txt file

- Lines that are TEC specific:
    - bin/class-tec-changelog-formatter.php -> file name can be changed to match the plugin
    - bin/class-tec-changelog-formatter.php L3 -> `* Jetpack Changelogger Formatter for The Events Calendar`
    - bin/class-tec-changelog-formatter.php L5 -> `* @package The Events Calendar`
    - bin/class-tec-changelog-formatter.php L14 -> `* Jetpack Changelogger Formatter for The Events Calendar`
    - bin/class-tec-changelog-formatter.php L16 -> `* Class TEC_Changelog_Formatter`
    - bin/class-tec-changelog-formatter.php L18 -> `class TEC_Changelog_Formatter extends Parser implements FormatterPlugin {`
    - bin/class-tec-changelog-formatter.php L40 ->`private $title = '# The Events Calendar Changelog';`
    - changelog.md -> entire file is plugin specific... I see in ET that it has a `changelog.txt` but not `.md` 
      - Reached out to Dimi and it seems like this is something we should make uniform throughout plugins.
    - composer.json -> The lines vary so it's important to pay attention to which section you're adding them to. 
      - Also this line has tec in it: `"filename": "bin/class-tec-changelog-formatter.php"` -> make sure to change to whatever you changed the file to! 
      - Don't make any changes to composer.lock - just run `composer update` to implement the new dependencies
