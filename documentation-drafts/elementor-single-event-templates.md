# Elementor Single Event Templates

## Script

Hi! In this video I'm going to walk you through how to use an Elementor template for a single event page with the free versions of Elementor and TEC. 

On this site I just have TEC and Elementor free active and the Hello Elementor theme. 

The first thing you need to do is go to Elementor > Settings and make sure "Events" are checked for post types. 

Then we can set up an event like usual. For technical reasons, only Classic Editor works with Elementor for events. If you create an event with the block editor, it was be forced to Classic editor once someone clicks on the Edit with Elementor button. 

(pause to set up event)

The event _content_ still comes from this page, but the style is what is edited in Elementor. 

All we need to do is save it as a draft and then we can open the Elementor editor to apply the template to this event. 

Once the Elementor editor opens up, we just have to apply the "Single Event Template" that is automatically added to "My templates" when you have TEC and Elementor activated together

The Events Calendar Starter Template is static for Elementor (free) users. It acts as a “snapshot” that you apply to a specific event at a specific time. If you tweak the starter template after it has been “applied” to an event, that event will not be updated with those changes. Only new events where you apply that template will inherit the tweaks.

Due to the way default templates work, you'll notice that the description of the event gets bumped to the top of the page. To fix this, all you have to do is copy that element, paste is where you want it on the event and then delete the original element.

You may also notice that the template has _all_ event widgets automatically added. If you did not add any content to that part of the event, even though it is showing in editor it will not appear on the frontend. 

You can make any adjustments you like to the single event now, just like any other Elementor page! Just note that these changes will NOT be applied to the starter template. You can adjust the starter template, but changes you make to individual events will only apply to that event. 

I'll add my global fonts to the event and then we can apply the changes and see how it looks. 

If you want to apply this template to an existing event, the process is very similar. 

## ECP and Elementor Pro

Hi! In this video I'm going to demonstrate how Elementor Pro can be used to apply a template to all single events. 

By default, no Elementor templates are assigned to events. You need to go
