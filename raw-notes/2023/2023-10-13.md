# GOAL: Keep exploring slic tests 

## Approach: 
- [X] Update `build` script to include `rm -rf composer.lock` in TEC directory and `--no-dev` in common
- [X] Update plugins on dev site
- [X] Practice getting slic up and running again 
- [X] Rewrite test for testing how setting affects TEC
- [X] Rewrite test for testing how setting affects TEC

## Notes
- Another review of slic workflow: `slic up` --> `slic run ...`
  - Had to [ask for help again in #tec-dev](https://lw.slack.com/archives/G01H7Q57P1C/p1697217592123029) - this time for the error `Error: No such network: slic249_slic
    Error: No such network: slic249_default`
  - If you have previously set slic up in a project you do not have to run anything more than the commands above (except maybe slic use to point it to a different plugin)

#### Re-writing the test for changing settings to change date format instead of multiDay:
- Use WP CLI to check the setting options for TEC
  - Hitting a roadblock for how to get `lando wp` commands to work - error is that when trying to run any lando command a debug terminal opens instead and I'm prompted to update lando 
  - Need to update Lando --> the `arm64` dmg file is the one for the newer Macs 
  - After updating, when trying to restart Lando I got that `error: no such proxy` message --> tore everything down and started over and it seems to be working again (see Aug 25 notes) 
  - Got everything updated, slic working again and now when trying to use `lando wp` commands they just hang and the debug terminal is still opened - feeling a bit stuck here so stepping away until next week!
- Instead, using DBeaver to look at the TEC setting options
  - Quick review: used `lando info` to grab the external port number (NOTE: avoid grabbing the port number for REDIS - loking for the MySQL port)
  - To connect to the db, `File > New > Database Connection` and then enter the port number and 'wordpress' for database, username,and password
  - Once connected, open the database and navigate to the wp_options table 
  - Do an SQL search in the top bar: ` option_name = 'tribe_events_calendar_options'`
- Reached out in [Slack](https://lw.slack.com/archives/G01H7Q57P1C/p1697496521888699) again (I feel so needy) and Luca came to my rescue for getting PHPStorm and WP CLI configured correctly
  - Needed to open settings (`cmd + ,`) 
  - Disable  `Debug > XDebug > Force break â€¦` options
  - Disable `Break at first line in PHP scripts` option
  - Checked which port XDebug running on in Lando:

```CLI 
$ lando ssh
> php -i | grep xdebug\.client_port
```
- 
  - That returned `9003`, so `9000` was removed from the list of `XDebug > Debug port:`
  - Applied these setting changes and restarted PHPStorm and then things were working!! 
- Found that the option is `dateWithYearFormat` 
- Added this test: 
```php
 /**
 * @test
 * Should test that changing settings affect events
 */
  public function should_test_effect_of_changing_settings_on_events()
  {
    // grab the original setting
    $original = tribe_get_option('dateWithYearFormat');

    // test how event behaves before changing setting
    $before = $original;
    $expected = 'F j, Y';
    $this->assertEquals($expected, $before, 'Event date format should not change before changing setting');

    //change the setting
    tribe_update_option('dateWithYearFormat', 'Y-m-d');

    $after = tribe_get_date_format( $with_year = true);
    $expected = 'Y-m-d';
    $this->assertEquals($expected, $after, 'Event date format should change after changing setting');

    // Make sure to change the option back after testing
    tribe_update_option('dateWithYearFormat', $original);

    // Double check that the option was changed back
    $post_test = tribe_get_date_format( $with_year = true);
    $expected = 'F j, Y';
    $this->assertEquals($expected, $post_test, 'Event date format should be changed back');
}
```
