## Notes
- Need to remember how to handle community submitted PRs -> previous notes on 2024-05-24.md 
  - For this one I just created new PRs because I needed to break it into two JIRA tickets.
- Remember to add the `@since` tag when changing something in the code. 
- How does `{@inheritDoc}` work?
  - When you include `{@inheritDoc}` in a DocBlock, it tells tools like IDEs, documentation generators, or linters to pull in the parentâ€™s DocBlock description automatically.
  - The tag only inherits the description. It does not inherit additional annotations like `@since`, `@param`, or `@return`. 
    - Those still need to be explicitly defined in the child method if they differ or are required for clarity.
